## Download Spacewalk-18

1. Clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/brown-palm/Spacewalk-18-benchmark.git
cd Spacewalk-18-benchmark
```

2. Download videos
```
cd data
python download_videos.py
```

## Dataset Structure

### Videos

The videos are downloaded into `data/videos`. There are in total 18 videos and each one is the recording of a spacewalk mission. All the videos are at `29.97 FPS` with frame size ``720 x 1280``.

### Transcripts
The transcripts of the videos are in [`data/transcripts`](data/transcripts). They contain the global start and end times of each sentence in seconds. Please use `encoding='cp1252'` when reading them.

### Steps and animations
At the beginning of each video, an animation demonstrates the mission to be done by the astronauts. Based off the animation, the mission is devided into dozens of steps, which are listed in [`data/steps.json`](data/steps.json).

| Field Name         | Description                                                         |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| index              | The index of the step in the corresponding spacewalk mission. Step 0 stands for ``Irrelevant'' label. |
| caption            | The caption of the step, which is a phrase or a short sentence.     |
| transcript         | The transcript of the animation clip of the step. It includes all the sentences intersecting with the time interval `[animation_start, animation_end]`.  |
| animation_start    | The global start time of the animation clip of the step in seconds. |
| animation_end      | The global end time of the animation clip of the step in seconds.   |

### Annotations

We annotate the spacewalk recordings by segmenting them into the steps. The annotations are in [`data/annotation.json`](data/annotation.json). Note that one step may occur multiple times and the steps may appear interwoven, because there are two astronauts working in parallel in a mission.

| Field Name         | Description                                                              |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| video_start        | The global start time of the segment in seconds.                         |
| video_end          | The global end time of the segment in seconds.                           |
| frame_start        | The global start frame index of the segment.                             |
| frame_end          | The global end frame index of the segment.                               |
| label              | The step index that the segment belongs to. `-1` indicates unavailable.  |

## Tasks on Spacewalk-18
We have two tasks on Spacewalk-18 benchmark - [step recognition](#Task-1---Step-Recognition) and [video question answering](#Task-2---Video-Question-Answering). The training, validation, and test video splits are listed in [`tasks/split.json`](tasks/split.json). The step recognition task includes all three splits while the video question answering is for test purpose only.

### Task 1 - Step Recognition
Given a query timestamp $t$ in a video, step recognition aims to determine the step happening at $t$. The training, validation, and test samples are in `tasks/step_recognition/*.json`. We show in [`construct_samples.ipynb`](https://github.com/brown-palm/Spacewalk-18-benchmark/blob/main/tasks/step_recognition/construct_samples.ipynb) how they are constructed. You may use it to generate more training samples if they benefit your method. Moreover, we encourage you to go beyond these samples and fully use the training set videos to develop your model.

| Field Name         | Description                                            |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| timestamp          | The timestamp sampled as query timestamp $t$.        |
| frame_index        | The frame index of the query timestamp.             |
| label              | The ground truth label of the sample.                  |
| id                 | A unique ID of the sample.                             |

Our tasks enables model evaluation under varying temporal context window lengths $w$. In this setting, a model needs to determine frame $t$'s corresponding step given the video clip $[t-w/2, t+w/2]$. We provide the code to calculate the video start and end times and collect the transcripts in the clip for any specified context length $w$. See [`construct_context_window.ipynb`](https://github.com/brown-palm/Spacewalk-18-benchmark/blob/main/tasks/step_recognition/construct_context_window.ipynb).

#### Evaluation Metrics
We use accuracy, mAP, and IoU to evaluate the performance on the step recognition task. The code is in [`evaluation.py`](tasks/step_recognition/evaluation.py). To use it, please organize your predictions in a JSON file in the following format:
```
{
      "03152022": [
            {
                  "prediction": 1,
                  "score": [0.4, 0.8, ..., 0.2]
            },
            {
                  "prediction": 0,
                  "score": [0.9, 0.3, ..., 0.6]
            },
            ... ...
      ],
      "11152022": [
            ... ...
      ]
}
```
The $i$-th item under each video ID is your prediction to the $i$-th sample. `prediction` is a predicted label used to compute accuracy. `score` is a list of scores for each category used to compute mAP. The length of `score` should be the same as the number of categories in the corresponding video. If your method does not provide category scores, you can omit `score` in your file.

You can use `--gt` to specify the ground truth file and `--pred` to specify your prediction file. For example, to evaluate your predictions on the test set, run
```
python evaluation.py \
--gt test.json \
--pred YOUR_PREDICTION_FILE.json
```

### Task 2 - Video Question Answering
The video question answering task includes 376 hour-long multi-choice questions. The videos are one-hour segments of the spacewalk recordings. The questions are available in [`tasks/question_answering/test.json`](https://github.com/brown-palm/Spacewalk-18-benchmark/blob/main/tasks/question_answering/test.json). While only a test set is provided, you are encouraged to leverage the videos in the training set to adapt your models to the spacewalk domain.

| Field Name               | Description                                          |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| question_id              | A unique ID of the question. |
| video_id                 | The video ID of the question. |
| video_start              | The global video start time of the video segment of the question. |
| video_end                | The global video end time of the video segment of the question. |
| question    | The question. |
| options     | A list of four options. |
| answer      | The answer, which is the index of the correct option. |
| type        | The question type. We include five types of questions. |

#### Evaluation Metrics
We use accuracy to evaluate the performance on the video qeustion answering task. The code is in [`evaluation.py`](tasks/question_answering/evaluation.py). Please organize your predictions in a JSON file, which is a list like:
```
[1, 0, 3, ..., 2]
```

You can use `--gt` to specify the ground truth file and `--pred` to specify your prediction file. For example,
```
python evaluation.py \
--gt test.json \
--pred YOUR_PREDICTION_FILE.json
```

Let's take a look.,695.9375,696.9375
"For US EVA seventy eight, Both crew members will be working together to replace a failed s band antenna.",699.1875,705.9375
EV one will be Tom Marshburn wearing the suit with the red stripes EV two will be Kayla Baron wearing the suit with the white stripes.,706.875,715.3125
"EV one will need out five, going up to see the spur and translating on to phase one.",716.625,722.25
There he will begin setting up the robotic arm.,724.125,726.8125
EV two will follow the same path initially.,729.625,731.875
Translate up to phase one and then continue zenith past the failed s band antenna and out t xpress logistics carrier number three.,734.125,743.625
"Once at the worksite, we do two will stow too bad and then retrieve a rigidizable tether.",749.875,758.625
This tether will be installed on the forward face of a logistic carrier and will be used to temporarily stow the degraded antenna as it's brought over to the carrier later in the EVA.,759.125,770.75
"EV1 will set up the robotic arm by installing a portable foot restraint, and then we'll ingress that foot restraint.",773.5,779.75
Get ready for our immersion.,780.125,781.5
"Eighty two will continue some prep work at the Express Logistics Carrier, and then will trend late to a degraded SASSA or S band antenna.",782.875,792.25
Eighty one will then provide guidance to the robotic arm to get him to his next work site.,800.0,806.5
"While EV two will release three connectors that provide heated power, functional power, and data One will put gimbal locks in place.",808.25,821.125
These will prevent the end kind of from moving as it's translated back and forth from t:one over to the Express Logistics area.,821.625,831.125
These four bolts will then be driven by the pistol grip tool.,834.5,838.0
Maybe one didn't have the robotic arm rotation around to the handrail side.,841.25,845.625
I the s rounded panel.,845.625,847.375
"While EV two releases a stanchion bolt that secures the antenna to structure, Once that bolt is released, the crew will work together and free the antenna and EV one will translate on their robotic arm to Express Logistics Carrier number three.",848.625,863.25
Those crew members will work together to temporarily stow this has spanned antenna and that rigidizable tether.,867.25,873.5
He'll then begin to prepare the spare so that it can be brought over to p one.,874.5,879.5
"They'll remove the thermal blanket, stow that out of the way.",879.75,883.75
This provides thermal conditioning for the unit.,884.5,886.75
They each have two bolts leaked to release and they'll be using a special tool called a ride angle drive in order to gain access to those bolts.,887.5,895.0
Eighty two will then get into position to drive the two remaining bolts.,898.5,902.5
Pistal grip tool will be used for that as well.,907.0,909.25
You could call the mask bolt.,909.25,910.75
There's a soft dock to overcome.,910.75,914.75
"Once that is overcome, EV one will gain control of the spare unit and then will ride the arm over to the p one worksite.",915.5,924.25
"Once at the p one worksite, both crew members will work together to soft dock this or will be temporarily held into the truss while e d two drives the stanchion bolt that will secure it in place.",927.75,940.66003
You need to then reconnect the three connectors that provide heater power functional power and data.,945.25,951.25
"EV one will release the four gimbal locks At this point, the antenna will be free to track satellites to allow good communication between space station and the ground.",955.0,968.25
Once the crew is clear of the worksite.,976.25,978.25
They'll perform a checkout on this antenna.,978.25,980.25
Both crew members will then head back to express logistics carrier number three.,981.25,986.0
At this point that we working together to stow the degraded unit back onto the flight releasable attach mechanism or the RAM is the way that these or user orbital replacement units are brought onto the space station.,994.0,1009.0
This one has heater power that helps to keep it alive.,1012.5,1015.5
EV two will drive two bolts to secure it to structure.,1017.0,1020.5
You call the mast bolts.,1022.5,1024.0
"Once those bolts are driven, the final step will be to install a thermal blanket that provides thermal conditioning and keeps this degraded unit available as a spare it's something needed.",1029.0,1040.25
"EV one will then back away from the worksite on the robotic arm and head back towards the truss Maybe two will then gather the bags and tools at the worksite Stoders on here, finding a straight tether.",1043.75,1063.25
So I head back to the airlock stow those bags.,1065.75,1069.75
"Meanwhile, TV One will be getting off of the robotic arm.",1070.5,1073.75
"And remove the portable foot restraint, and he'll return it to the starboard seated cart.",1077.0,1083.25
This is where he picked it up at the beginning of the EBA.,1083.61996,1087.0
One will then head back to the airlock as well.,1094.5,1097.0
"Both ingress, and this will conclude US EVA seventy eight.",1098.0,1103.5
That was EVA officer Art Thomason providing a voice over for the animation describing today's tasks.,1114.8,1120.5
We're back live in the equipment lock of the crew airlock.,1120.5,1123.255
Rajatari in the green shorts on the left of your screen and Mark Van de High on the right.,1124.5,1129.0
Marshburn and Barron are on the other side of the hatch and the crew lock as depressurization is underway.,1129.0,1134.0
Pressure is nearing five psi at which point they'll pause and do some systems checks.,1134.0,1139.0
"This will be the two hundred and forty fifth space walk in support of space station assembly, maintenance, and upgrades.",1148.6799999999998,1160.75
It will be the fifth space walk for astronaut Tom Marshburn.,1160.75,1164.0
He completed twenty four hours and twenty nine minutes of space walking time in his previous four EBAs.,1164.0,1168.5
It'll be Kayla Barron's first day of walking her career.,1169.0,1172.0
"This is the first space walk of expedition sixty six, which began back in mid October, and today's operation will ring in the thirteenth space walk of twenty twenty one.",1172.245,1180.75
"Okay, Kayla.",1189.9650000000001,1190.75
We're seeing five psi here.,1190.75,1192.5
So you can take the depress pump manualizations out to close and expect alert tone.,1192.5,1197.0
The depress pump man ice valve is closed.,1197.0,1199.675
Apoquel.,1200.0800160549998,1200.5800160499998

K.,1290.3125599999998,1290.5625599999998
I think you both can tell me that your o two actuators are in EVA after the load checks complete.,1290.5625599999998,1295.7500599999998
Any work.,1295.8750599999998,1296.6250599999998
Does that affirm?,1296.7500599999998,1297.5000599999998
And So it's going to EVA.,1297.6250599999998,1299.8750599999998
EV two zero two operator is an EVA.,1309.1250599999998,1311.9375599999998

"Tom, I You may have already set this for any catches.",1315.6875599999998,1318.3750599999998
Not yet.,1318.6250599999998,1319.3750599999998
Being worked for easy ones.,1320.1250599999998,1321.5000599999998
Let me get my suspicion out of this earlier.,1334.0000599999998,1337.3750599999998
And I'm getting a message for an o two actuator fault.,1361.6250599999998,1364.8750599999998
Yeah.,1367.2500599999998,1367.5000599999998
That typically happens when you put it when it's not completely in position.,1367.5000599999998,1370.5000599999998
"So try to get it all the way into the correct position EVA, and it should say it was a regular EVA, expecting a little bit.",1370.5000599999998,1376.2500599999998
I can press.,1377.5000599999998,1378.3750599999998

Both of you can expect an alert zone.,1422.5000599999998,1424.2500599999998
The front panel isolation valve is open.,1424.2500599999998,1427.7500599999998
Okay.,1428.3750599999998,1428.7500599999998
Stand by.,1428.7500599999998,1429.5000599999998
Okay.,1436.5000599999998,1436.7500599999998
The emergency m tab over here is open for both of you months or the super pressure gauge stays less than five decimal five.,1436.7500599999998,1443.1250599999998

And the crew lock is at two psi.,1448.3750599999998,1450.3750599999998
We're gonna keep change the depress pump manualization valve back to close.,1451.0000599999998,1455.7500599999998
Two copies at two psi will take the depress pump in as a valve to close.,1456.2500599999998,1460.7300599999999
That was astronaut Mark Van de High communicating that the checks were good.,1468.0000599999998,1472.0000599999998
"After the planned hold at five psi, we've continued to bring the crew lock down to vacuum.",1472.2500599999998,1476.7400799999998
It's now at about four psi.,1476.7500599999998,1478.2500599999998

"Due to the lack of opportunity to properly assess the risk, it could pose to the astronauts.",1497.0000599999998,1502.0000599999998
Teams decided to delay the spacewalk until more information was available.,1502.2500599999998,1506.0000599999998
However NASA determined that the orbit of the debris did not pose a risk to the scheduled spacewalk by Tom Marshburn and Kayla Barron or to the International Space Station Operations.,1508.2500599999998,1517.5000599999998
Delaying the spacewalk provided an offer duty for NASA to evaluate the risk from the debris notification.,1518.5000599999998,1523.2500599999998
The space station schedule and operations were able to easily accommodate the delay of the spacewalk.,1524.0000599999998,1529.0000599999998
"Even though the SASSA became faulty, the crews had no trouble communicating with mission control in Houston.",1604.7500599999998,1609.7500599999998
The International Space Station has several built in redundancies.,1610.2500599999998,1613.0000599999998
"So in the event that something happens, they always have a way of communicating of the crew.",1613.2500599999998,1618.5000599999998
"Even though this antenna becoming faulty hasn't had a big impact on the astronauts, emission managers decided to go ahead and plan the spacewalk to ensure communications in redundancy.",1626.2500599999998,1634.7500599999998

Yeah.,8008.62516,8008.87516
"Caleb, those are good settings, and you have a go to break torque.",8008.87516,8011.50016
One turn only.,8011.50016,8012.37516
Very good.,8014.25016,8015.00016
One for me.,8015.00016,8016.00016
"You can hear now that the astronauts, Tom Marshburn and Kayla Baron will be working together on this step.",8016.87516,8021.45019
Marshburn will tether the SASSA before it's set completely free with the release of the stanchion bolt that Barron is removing.,8021.87516,8027.75016
This is the one that attaches the antenna unit to the p one truss structure sure.,8028.00016,8031.75016
The view you see here live on your screen is Kayla Barron retrieving her pistol grip tool and configuring it to break torque.,8060.75016,8066.45518
On that stanchion bolt that attaches the degraded facet to the space station.,8066.50016,8070.00016
"And, Drew, please torque it back in one turn.",8075.75016,8078.25016
I just wanna confirm I was fully seated on the boat.,8078.25016,8081.25016
A little hard to tell because it's been there.,8081.37516,8084.00016
I'm scanning out PGT.,8084.325159999999,8086.00016

"And torque is broken, Drew.",8094.50016,8096.25016
"Copy that, Kayla.",8099.50016,8100.25016
On it originally?,8100.50016,8101.50016
"Yeah, Kayla.",8104.00016,8104.75016
"If you had experienced any running torque at all, we we expected that you broke torque if you're experiencing some running torque.",8104.75016,8111.00016

Good.,8313.50016,8313.66686
For Sandra Apple?,8313.83346,8315.00016
You have a go to release.,8315.00016,8316.25016
We're expecting about eighteen turns.,8316.25016,8318.50016
We want you to maintain some pressure on that bolt head.,8318.50016,8321.50016
Okay.,8323.50016,8324.00016
That's my body position a little bit here.,8324.50016,8327.00016
Starting turn.,8331.50016,8332.50016
"Nine turns, and I'm just gonna readjust the Kayla, we were just gonna have you to double check your PGT settings.",8347.51016,8359.16686
It looks like we might be a little higher counterclockwise speed right now.,8359.16686,8364.00016
Yep.,8364.51016,8365.01016
I think I got knocked into counter three.,8366.005159999999,8370.00016
Back in counter two now.,8370.50016,8372.25016
Alright.,8373.50016,8373.66686
That's a good check.,8373.66686,8375.00016
The degraded unit is in a position known as a soft dock.,8376.75016,8382.26016
"It's connected to the space station, but only that Stanchion bolt is keeping it in place.",8382.26016,8386.50016
Kayla Barron is working to remove it.,8386.50016,8389.00016
The next step on the procedures after this has accomplished is to,8397.00016,8400.00016
Move it over to the Express Logistics Carrier number three and temporarily stow it using a rigid tether that Kayla Baron had installed earlier in the space walk.,8400.080119999999,8408.656079999999
"And, Drew, could you say in total sirings I'm looking for here?",8412.22374,8415.242481

Address is eighteen It's spring out.,8420.719321999999,8429.164262999999
We do expect it to spring out with a light touch.,8433.182003,8435.52108
That count could could be a little after because it's kind of difficult to tell if it's fully seated.,8439.248302,8444.465941999999
But I'm gonna get it back on there and then some more turns.,8445.054943,8449.792824

That's Okay.,8503.97073,8507.129135
"Well, that sounds good.",8507.129135,8508.08865
And we're just gonna have you pull accurately as close as you can to the center of gravity down there and light touch from Tom as he's already commented.,8508.08865,8517.503219999999
Copy.,8519.442,8519.942
Could you please pull it away from the branch and out?,8520.729879999999,8523.40854
It looks pretty safe.,8523.40854,8524.908035
Coming the little way.,8525.92728,8527.546715
Okay.,8528.64591,8528.92577

It's time.,8620.303,8620.7028
You ready for motion?,8620.7028,8621.542379999999
Ready for motion.,8621.542379999999,8622.32224
We'll start with GCA.,8622.541879999999,8623.38146

And I'm seeing good pressure on him.,8672.58276,8674.32216
You're getting now the helmet camera views of NASA astronaut Kayla Barron as she translates back to the Express Logistics Carrier number three.,8699.864539999999,8707.64091
"Astronaut, Tom Marshburne, is taking the express route over to the work site.",8713.64741,8717.59483
He's taking the robotic arm while carrying the degraded SASSA that the two of them just work together to break free.,8717.59483,8723.012359999999
"Hey, guys.",8729.127559999999,8729.4874
"The sun will be coming up, and we're about fifty minutes ahead on the time line.",8729.4874,8733.1858

"And, Tom, this is gonna be about a sub minute long, Joe Cat.",8742.329689999999,8745.20823
It's gonna be Corus motion.,8745.20823,8746.54783

"Both astronauts are making their way out to the next workstation, the Express Logistics Carrier three.",8847.01816,8852.15583
Their next task is to temporarily stow the degrade at SASSA.,8854.01456,8857.83289
They're gonna put it on a rigid tether that Kayla Barron had installed earlier.,8858.172489999999,8862.190709999999
This task is expected to take about twenty five minutes.,8862.21046,8865.01929
"However, our two space walking astronauts are making great time.",8865.118999999999,8868.29766

They reported that they're a third of the way over to the worksite and as they may make their way over.,8925.91296,8930.30976
I'm gonna take a question from Twitter.,8930.30976,8932.04911
"We have a question from Shazzy who asks, are they always hooked connected to the ISS during spacewalk?",8932.22876,8937.08656
That's a great question.,8939.01496,8940.0944
And the answer is yes.,8940.0944,8941.33376
They are always tethered to the space station.,8941.33376,8943.6926
You may often hear the Capcom or the Ground IV working with the or not working on tether configurations.,8943.6926,8949.68946
"For instance, earlier, Tom Marshburn had to get his tethers from the space station and onto the robotic arm.",8950.46876,8955.335159999999
"However, in the unlikely event that they become untethered, Marshburn and Barron both have safer units on.",8955.814919999999,8962.5518
SAFR is a shorter way of saying simplified aid for EVI rescue.,8963.38986,8966.6085
"If you're familiar with the Jetpack, the SAFERS are not too far off.",8966.868059999999,8970.206699999999
"There weren't worn during spacewalks as a precaution only, and they're only used if an astronaut were to become untethered from the space station.",8971.49476,8978.59146
"In this unlikely situation, astronaut would use their test their SAFER to propel themselves back to the space station just like a jetpack.",8979.12009,8985.85696
See you there?,8986.95616,8987.69606
You put that on right in front.,8992.322909999999,8994.10226
"Point, Joe, and the line is gone.",9000.040138027,9001.1593397
You're gonna dial the claims show up?,9001.1593397,9006.3556288
I can just hear this off.,9006.3556288,9007.79516
Yep.,9007.9181288,9008.15641

"It will be her first spacewalk while Tom Marshbourne is on his fourth or sorry, his fifth.",9119.62516,9125.25016
Marshbourne's first three spacewalks took place over the course of the fifteen day STS one hundred and twenty seven mission back in two thousand nine.,9125.31266,9132.12516
The mission saw the delivery of the Japanese built exposed facility and the experiment logistics module exposed sections of the space station.,9132.25016,9140.50016

Do it there?,9293.37516,9294.25016
Alright.,9294.25016,9294.75016
Yeah.,9299.25016,9299.37516
I think I got several pictures of it there.,9299.37516,9302.25016
It's the one closest to the high gain antenna.,9302.25016,9304.50016
Yeah.,9305.75016,9306.00016
There's two of them.,9306.00016,9307.00016

But further your end needs to go torque or we're gonna ask a little bit back.,9367.75016,9378.00016
That's looking pretty good.,9378.25016,9379.75016
The drawers are fully the pedals are fully popped out.,9381.25016,9384.00016
There they go.,9384.00016,9385.00016

They need to lean back to the bike.,9439.00016,9441.00016
The race is coming off.,9441.37516,9443.25016
And you're in a body frame now.,9443.25016,9444.62516

You're hearing the voices of Tom Marshburn and Kayla Barron.,9466.50016,9469.50016
And as Tom communicates to the operators of the robotic arm Matias Mauer in his backup Rajatari.,9469.50016,9476.25016
He's giving commands so he can hand off the degraded sasa to Kayla Varen who will work to stow the ASSA on the Express Logistics Carrier.,9477.25016,9485.00016
"Sorry for the DCA to publish to the SPHERES site Are you ready for We're in a brief but expected handover period between satellites right now, getting a line view of mission control in Houston.",9485.50016,9506.00016

She then went back to the p one trust where Tom Marshburn was to help remove the degraded SASSA.,9545.33346,9551.00016
They've both now gone back to the express logistics carrier where they're stowing the degraded SASSA.,9551.00016,9556.00016
"Fortunately for their next step, they're going to stay here at the Express Logistics Carrier and retrieve the spare.",9556.50016,9562.33346

Regular clearance.,9597.50016,9598.50016
That'd be twenty centimeters' body forward moving.,9600.28004516,9602.619400599999

I'm working the nadir bolt on my side.,10850.65657,10853.40657

This is an activity he was originally going to do with Kayla Barron.,10880.25032,10883.75032
"However, she was able to get the launch bolts off earlier in the space walk.",10883.75032,10888.175309999999

Correct?,10915.50032,10915.87532
I don't expect the torque.,10915.87532,10918.37532

"The ground IV, Drew Morgan, was able to communicate that with Tom Marshburn, who's working on his now.",10970.00032,10974.87532

"Kayla, can I just go ahead and get a glove and hat and a paper check from you?",11064.75032,11068.695319999999
I can tell you now my half is dry.,11072.25032,11074.25032
I'm gonna wait on gloves in paper until after the bolt because I'm already in a good position with my hand pull.,11074.25032,11080.75032

We talked about the advantage that Tom Marshburn and Kayla Baron had To find out that the degraded unit had happened before they left the ground so they could train into the neutral buoyancy laboratory for you.,12554.750419999998,12567.000419999998
For the stand and I've got my so pretty hit or attack.,12569.000419999998,12575.250419999998

This all port part of some preparations they did before the spacewalk.,12615.773857499998,12619.719169999998
It also included some onboard verification fit checks where they tried on their spacesuits and made sure that they're comfortable and easy to move around.,12620.047294999998,12626.344169999998

That's a great question.,12723.750419999998,12724.812919999998

"If you recall earlier in EVA, he had installed these to keep the sasa in the locked position.",12923.500419999998,12929.000419999998
Did you get it published?,12929.000419999998,12931.250419999998
It seems like we're close.,12931.250419999998,12932.750419999998

Alright.,12954.000419999998,12954.250419999998
There's a solid position.,12954.250419999998,12955.750419999998
How does that look?,12955.750419999998,12956.750419999998
Good to me.,12957.500419999998,12958.295459999998

I can starboard.,12989.000419999998,12990.000419999998
Now I'll push straight down.,12992.250419999998,12993.750419999998
Erin and Marshburn now working together to get into the right position to install the spare sasa.,12996.250419999998,13000.630459999998
Activity.,13001.000419999998,13001.500419999998

Alright.,13007.500419999998,13007.750419999998
It does help to pop in there.,13007.750419999998,13009.475459999998
Yep.,13009.500419999998,13009.625419999998
It looks great.,13009.625419999998,13010.375419999998
It's flushed flushed with the plate.,13010.375419999998,13012.000419999998
Great.,13012.000419999998,13012.250419999998
I'm getting a little slight out because it is not moving.,13012.250419999998,13015.000419999998
So it's all good.,13015.000419999998,13017.210439999999

Earlier during the spacewalk.,13044.250419999998,13045.750419999998
"Earlier during the spacewalk, Kayla Barron, removed a stanchion bolt.",13050.000419999998,13054.125419999998
That was the last stop to replacing the to removing the degraded SASSA unit.,13054.125419999998,13059.250419999998
Now one of her first half in installing the new one is driving the stanchion bolt again.,13059.500419999998,13065.000419999998
She's getting her tool configured to do so now with Ground Ivy Drew Morgan.,13065.500419999998,13069.250419999998
"Little bit of side load, but you're good now.",13069.750419999998,13071.750419999998
Okay.,13071.750419999998,13072.250419999998
It popped right back in again.,13076.665459999998,13078.500419999998
Looks like nothing's good now.,13078.500419999998,13080.500419999998
"Kayla, we're expecting seventeen to eighteen and a half turns, and we'll take your torque turn and light Okay.",13080.750419999998,13087.750419999998

Your PGT eleven.,13093.500419999998,13094.750419999998
There's a side left handover.,13096.250419999998,13097.750419999998
You're getting a live view now of NASA astronaut Caleb Barron driving the stanchion mount bolts.,13103.750419999998,13109.500419999998
"Meanwhile, off screen, Tom Marshburne, is holding the SASSA in place attached to the robotic arm.",13110.000419999998,13115.250419999998
We work my way back down a little bit more.,13115.250419999998,13117.750419999998
Fucking p j p s t's going in.,13121.000419999998,13123.250419999998
"And twenty third, Sonia?",13126.705519999998,13132.500419999998
"Twenty two third, zero?",13132.500419999998,13134.23052
Other parking.,13168.500419999998,13169.340519999998
It's still driving.,13169.340519999998,13172.000419999998
I think There's a as the torque is considered to be increased side load.,13173.250419999998,13182.500419999998
The body of the PGT and our fears of it or the fasted self inner ears with the body of the PGT.,13183.500419999998,13192.000419999998
Yeah.,13192.000419999998,13192.250419999998
So it's kinda difficult to maintain a perfect position.,13192.250419999998,13195.500419999998
"Maybe I'll get a light touch, maybe me.",13196.500419999998,13198.750419999998
On there.,13200.440177269998,13201.140128399999
"So there, I'm feeling the some side load there.",13202.279776899999,13204.617667499999
Did you still start to know?,13205.719229999999,13207.015479999998
I'll push against anybody to release that.,13212.891104999999,13216.187979999999
The record side mode.,13216.297354999999,13217.594229999999
"As NASA astronaut, Kayla Baron, we're to drive those bolts.",13222.969229999999,13226.703604999999

So I think so I think there's a little bit of play in the A flat position.,13235.719229999999,13246.062979999999
"And what I'm wondering is, I think, Let me get it came off, but, actually, the soft dock.",13248.031729999999,13256.687979999999
So Right.,13256.687979999999,13260.031729999999
"What I'm thinking is maybe the bolt wasn't actually engaged in the threads, obviously, or else it wouldn't have done that?",13260.031729999999,13266.312979999999
Can you push straight nadir and push a little bit port?,13266.875479999999,13273.875479999999
A little bit port.,13274.500479999999,13275.625479999999
Yep.,13275.750479999999,13276.250479999999
"Hand back a little bit server, please.",13279.125479999999,13280.937979999999
I'll put the straight meter into the plate.,13281.812979999999,13285.375479999999
"And if you can try to hold it right there, Alright.",13286.875479999999,13290.312979999999
I will try again.,13290.750479999999,13292.000479999999
CounterACT any side load.,13292.187979999999,13293.812979999999
And that was seventeen turns.,13332.375479999999,13334.750479999999
Yeah.,13335.750479999999,13336.000479999999
I'm gonna keep a light touch and gonna pull on a little bit.,13336.000479999999,13341.005479999998
Can I finish my call?,13341.500479999999,13342.875479999999

Started on one or four.,14406.0355362,14407.765379999999
One of the get ahead tasks is looking at a bolt I was on the airlock.,14421.15663,14425.71913
It was showing some minor wear and tear.,14425.71913,14427.71913

Copy.,14434.90663,14435.40663
I wanted to know for that.,14439.46913,14440.685378
This is unrelated to the SASSA.,14442.59413,14444.46913

Yeah.,14459.25038,14459.46913
It's not rolling either.,14459.46913,14460.68788
"Okay, Tom.",14469.56288,14470.12538
"What we're gonna do is stay with the original settings at bravo four and then go back to bolt number four right side towards your boats, and we're gonna try to do that single turn again.",14470.12538,14480.25038
Okay.,14482.12538,14482.62538
Verifying bravo four.,14483.50038,14485.31288

"That's great, Tom.",14504.87538,14505.68788
Let's go to bolt one.,14505.68788,14506.62538
Do the same thing.,14506.62538,14507.75038
That's right side toward your helmet.,14507.75038,14509.50038
I have to know the same thing.,14511.68788,14513.12538
It worked and good torque on that.,14513.12538,14516.62538
Try to get on that.,14519.18788,14520.06288
"I like it there, but, basically, it's didn't see any slack at the run to be doing it again.",14520.06288,14528.37538
Yeah.,14530.12538,14530.37538
"In fact, it's not turning on it.",14530.37538,14532.25038
You know this afternoon a little bit?,14540.87538,14542.37538
Do you mind getting motions again?,14542.37538,14544.00038
One more time?,14546.25038,14547.12538
"We're following along, Tom.",14551.25038,14552.62538
Let us know what you get there.,14552.75038,14554.00038
We are going into a period here where we may have a little bit of Just wanted to give you a heads up.,14554.00038,14558.37538
Copy.,14559.62538,14560.12538
So it's breaking this.,14562.12538,14563.50038
Just breaking the torque.,14564.87538,14566.12538
One is not moving yet.,14566.37538,14567.87538
Alright.,14577.37538,14577.87538
"Tom, we copy.",14577.87538,14578.87538
We're checking.,14578.87538,14579.50038
We may go to a different PGT settings stand by.,14579.50038,14581.935389999999
Copy.,14583.50038,14584.00038
"So, Tom, an additional suggestion at the original setting bravo four still We're gonna ask you to put a little bit of movement into the high gain intensity if you can jiggle while attempting that one turn if you're able.",14604.62538,14617.12538
K.,14619.12538,14619.62538
It worked.,14620.25038,14620.87538
Loading that cable.,14621.62538,14624.50038
I'm not getting motion on the system.,14636.37538,14638.25038
It's still torquing out one more time.,14639.00038,14642.37538
"While Marshburn works on loosening those bolts communicating with the ground, Okay, Tom.",14648.87538,14655.00038
"We are, at this point, gonna go to PGT setting, a bravo seven, so counterclockwise two.",14655.25038,14660.87538
So this is a high torque we think that this might break off the bolt.,14660.87538,14664.75038
So just be ready to catch that if you're able.,14664.75038,14667.00038
Copy.,14668.75038,14669.25038
From all the seven.,14669.75038,14671.00038

Okay.,14698.75038,14699.00038
Three quarter turn there.,14699.00038,14700.50038
A little bit more.,14700.64036,14702.75038

It worked.,14767.00038,14767.75038
Internally?,14772.50038,14773.00038
More turnings for both three.,14774.50038,14776.00038
Wonderful too.,14777.75038,14778.75038
Good news.,14779.25038,14779.75038

Turns.,14792.00038,14792.50038
Now we're gonna bolt one.,14795.75038,14797.25038
Ready for bolt one.,14797.87538,14800.25038
"Right side, Holden.",14803.75038,14804.50038
You can do it motion easy motion?,14807.75038,14809.50038
Sorry.,14811.75038,14812.25038
Bolts are obviously free.,14823.50038,14824.50038
"They were just not easily coming away from their a position on the stow the PGT, but that's the right next move.",14824.50038,14834.50038
Yeah.,14835.00038,14835.25038
"Tom, you can go ahead and and stow your PGT and rotate those bolts back away from the step into the unlocked position.",14835.25038,14841.75038
And then just verify that the gimbal lock bolts are secured in that unlocked position.,14842.27538,14847.00038
Work.,14847.00038,14847.50038
"Now that the gimbal lock bolts, all four of them have been loosened, It's now Tom Marshburn's task to rotate the gimbal lock bolts away and into the unlocked position.",14853.50038,14864.50038
"Once complete, Marshburn will verify with the ground to communicate that they are secure and unlocked position.",14874.00038,14880.25038
"Four is not much, and it's loosened the slot, but not coming around again there even after jiggle in the head panel.",14886.00038,14893.50038
Working on three now.,14895.25038,14896.75038
"This task that Marshburn is working on, is the last step before he gets the go to power up the sasa.",14899.50038,14906.50038
"And, Tom, I just wanted to check back with you.",14910.965349999999,14916.00038
Are they all rotating back okay?,14916.00038,14918.25032
One and four again are not two and three after some jiggling.,14918.25032,14925.25038
Rotation of the stuff and did go back.,14926.50038,14928.50038
I'll make sure they're fully out of the globe.,14928.66708,14932.00038
They're fully back in the So positions are one and four.,14932.50038,14938.50038
"They'll move in the slot, but are not coming out.",14939.50038,14942.25038
So I think I need to juggle the avoiding the cable.,14942.25038,14948.00038
It wouldn't that system.,14950.50038,14952.00038
"Marsh Bend confirming now that while some of the bolts have been unlocked with ease, Others need a little bit more coaxing.",14956.50038,14963.00038
"We're following, Tom, and we're still talking.",14968.00038,14970.50038
Just wanted to offer up if we think Tom's gonna be troubleshooting for a while.,14980.91528,14990.66708
"I could go work with you, get a test, and not far from here.",14990.66708,14995.66708
So I should be able to move back up while he's still passing over here.,14995.66708,14999.345379999999
"Caleb, for you.",15004.9964738,15006.0355362
I appreciate the offer.,15006.0355362,15006.9183488
We're I don't think we're gonna go to get ahead just yet.,15006.9183488,15009.0394425
We do wanna have you inspect the RFG box of the degraded unit.,15009.0394425,15013.5394425
We'll just give it a look over if you have the spare capacity to take a look take a look and take some photos of it.,15014.28163,15021.81288
That'll appreciate.,15021.81288,15022.578505
And we're about two minutes from a handover.,15023.25038,15025.09413
"And, Drew, I'm not getting a lot of motion from the septic.",15031.516005,15034.34413
"Like, we put it on the ground unit.",15034.62538,15036.15663
"The one in four seemed to be Well, they're they're pretty loose when they're in the slot.",15036.15663,15047.12538
They're just not riding over either slot.,15047.43788,15051.09413
Despite some rolling and jiggling?,15053.75038,15055.96913
I'm not actually seeing a lot of motion in there.,15057.06288,15059.50038
Seven seven.,15059.75038,15060.71913
Just a new shaft there.,15062.50038,15063.90663
Okay.,15064.75038,15065.25038
So I'm gonna see what?,15065.25038,15066.50038
We appreciate the words.,15067.50038,15068.81288
"Right now, we understand that one and four are the problem bolts.",15069.18788,15073.43788
And so what we thought we'd have you do is set your PGT to alpha two and put one additional turn on bolts one and four.,15073.43788,15081.00038
Alpha two.,15083.31288,15084.18788
More additional service.,15084.75038,15085.93788
It seems like does does that make sense from my perspective?,15085.93788,15091.00038
"So alpha two If you verify, go for four.",15098.00038,15103.18788
One turn only?,15105.06288,15106.12538
One turn only.,15106.50038,15107.50038
One more turn.,15110.12538,15111.12538
Still wet still in there?,15116.81288,15118.12538
Sure.,15118.87538,15119.06288
Number one.,15119.06288,15119.87538
Once and complete.,15129.12538,15130.12538
Okay.,15133.75038,15134.12538
This one came out.,15134.12538,15135.37538
"Oh, four volts.",15159.12538,15160.12538
"Andrew, come check?",15163.75038,15164.87538
Yep.,15165.75038,15166.00038
So we're back with you after the handover.,15166.00038,15167.75038
So we were standing by for how that went with those additional turns on one and four.,15168.12538,15172.04038
Yeah.,15173.75038,15174.00038
That was the trick.,15174.00038,15174.75038
"A little stopped, but one and four finally.",15174.75038,15177.12538
"Actually, one would not move.",15177.25038,15179.00038
"So, excuse me, four would not move.",15179.00038,15181.12538
Even after the extra turn.,15181.50038,15183.12538
"But then after the extra turn, number one did move, went back to four, and then it popped out as well.",15183.50038,15189.00038
So all four bolts are in the stow position.,15189.37538,15191.25038
Alright.,15193.50038,15193.87538
That's exactly what we wanted to hear.,15193.87538,15195.75038
"We're in a brief but expected handover between satellites getting a live view now of mission control, Houston, where flight director and ground IV are communicating with Tom Marshburn, who is trouble shooting, getting some gimbal locks loosened.",15200.12538,15217.25038
"Again, this allows free movement once the sassos powered on, so that way it can communicate with satellites.",15217.87538,15224.62538
Okay.,15227.00038,15227.37538
"Tom, I'm just double checking on it.",15227.37538,15229.50038
Yep.,15229.87538,15230.25038
So I just go to position.,15230.25038,15231.50038
Copy.,15232.37538,15232.75038
Go ahead.,15232.75038,15233.50038
So we wanted to also just give you a quick update that you guys are about an hour and forty minutes ahead of the timeline.,15234.87538,15239.75038
Our limited consumable is still Metox.,15239.87538,15242.25038
"Seven and a half hours, so plenty of time.",15242.75038,15244.62538
And every you guys are doing great.,15244.62538,15247.62538
This is everything that we had hoped.,15247.62538,15249.75038
This is perfect.,15249.75038,15250.75038
"Tom, you're gonna be doing empty handed fly back, take us some pictures and video, and then Kayla will take any words that you have on your inspection so far.",15251.50038,15259.25038
Okay.,15261.50038,15262.00038
"Once I get into the jack up, I'll give you those words.",15262.00038,15264.75038
We'll get started.,15265.50038,15267.50038
"Thanks for your And, Matija, ready for the maneuver.",15267.50038,15271.75038
Alright.,15272.00038,15272.50038
"Sounds good, Tom.",15273.00038,15274.00038
"We're gonna first have to take you twenty standard nader and then undo what we did before, and then we'll take you to a temp stow back on position.",15274.00038,15281.00038
And so copy your go from maneuver to the ELC three step back up position.,15281.25038,15285.62538
I'll let you know before Russian starts.,15285.62538,15287.25038
Copy.,15287.50038,15288.00038
Yes.,15289.00038,15289.25038
I'm going for the maneuver.,15289.25038,15290.50038
Here comes twenty centimeters and nadir.,15291.00038,15292.750409999999
"We just got confirmation that well ahead of schedule, our space walkers NASA astronauts, Kayla Barron, and Tom Marshburn, have installed the spare sasa to the International Space Station's P1 truss.",15300.15541,15312.25038
This involved installing a stanchion bolt and connecting some wires that Barron had previously disconnected.,15313.00038,15321.00038
This allowed power to the unit.,15322.25038,15323.75038
And Tom Marshburn worked diligently to get the gimbal locks released.,15324.25038,15328.00038
The fourth one gave him a little bit of trouble and required a little bit more coaxing.,15328.50038,15332.50038
"But at the end of the day, Tom Marshburn was able to get the job done.",15332.50038,15335.75038
Starting motion.,15336.75038,15337.75038
You did motion.,15344.75038,15345.75038
Here we go.,15351.50038,15352.50038
Good motion.,15365.25038,15366.00038
As centimeters ramping out?,15369.00038,15370.46538
Index will take me about a meter port.,15374.25038,15377.25038
I can mute her for speaker motion.,15377.54038,15381.00038
Cinemas.,15392.50038,15393.00038
K.,15401.75038,15402.00038
Wrapping out.,15402.00038,15402.75038
Bosch is complete.,15402.75038,15403.37538
So we're gonna set up for a Joe Casa.,15403.37538,15405.25038
Alright.,15405.25038,15405.50038
Thank you.,15405.50038,15406.11538
"And, Tom, we copied your go for Sasa Power Ups, so we're working that now.",15408.50038,15412.25038
And the motion is about I want to set it as long.,15448.630379999999,15454.75038
Okay.,15454.75038,15455.25038
And it's gonna be mostly for a motion back to where you were before and you'll see three.,15456.50038,15460.00038
Copy.,15460.00038,15460.50038
"And, Drew, when you're ready to copy, I've got words on the we discussed our RFG.",15464.61038,15472.75038
We're all listening.,15474.50038,15475.50038
So I have a good view of what would be the sort of nadir face and then the larger surface area based I'm not phased out for when it was installed right now.,15478.50038,15494.62538
I don't have a great view of the ADENA space.,15494.62538,15499.00038
"But on the the main area of the RFG that was based outboard when installed, There's discoloration on the ninety three along the was crowd aired.",15499.25038,15517.50038
Is what appears to be a small pit at the center?,15529.00038,15532.25038
MOD strip.,15536.00038,15537.00038
And then on the more nadir face and the grid on the nadir part of the main claim.,15539.50038,15550.00038
There are also evidence of MMLD strikes.,15551.20028,15555.00038
"And in some areas, it looks Taylor Woods standby real quick.",15555.50038,15558.66708
B nine u three?,15558.83368,15560.25038
Okay.,15561.00038,15561.50038
K.,15564.00038,15564.50038
We were going through a period of pretty ratty comm there.,15567.00038,15569.33368
So we lost some of that standby for one moment.,15569.33368,15572.50038
Uh-huh.,15572.50038,15573.00038
"You doing, Tom?",15578.695329999999,15579.25038
Doing good.,15579.25038,15580.00038
"The first pass of the day, because it's helping out.",15580.50038,15584.00038
Baron and Marshburn are now preparing to power up the SASSA.,15603.7581325,15607.1370388
This is the spare that they took from the Express Logistics Carrier over to the P1 Trust to replace the degraded unit.,15607.1956325,15613.8206325
We're driving the area down.,15613.8206325,15615.08032
"Following its successful power up, they will head back to the ELC and stow the degraded unit.",15615.3206325,15622.109695
You have I'm sorry about cutting off there.,15622.109695,15624.984695
No problem at all.,15626.84407,15628.06282
I was just also mentioning that some of the spots that look like MMOD strike.,15629.359695,15636.09407
"It looks just like, you know, sort of that silver metal underneath.",15637.21907,15642.31282
And then other areas are more like a brownish orange color around the area of the head.,15642.96907,15649.15657
"Know if that is just some sort of oxidation or something or, like, the age of the hit.",15652.28157,15658.00032
"From my vantage point, I can probably see at least in ball the MOD strike.",15660.31282,15666.37532
I was able to get some what I think will be decent pictures of the faces I've described.,15667.12532,15673.18782
And I might be able to get eyes on the other face once we have it installed on the frame.,15674.56282,15679.93782
"Copy all, Kayla.",15686.87532,15687.87532
That's great description.,15687.87532,15688.81282
We may take you up on that offer to do further inspection once we get in.,15688.87532,15692.04532
All.,15692.12532,15692.25032
"And then we wanted to confirm with you the number you were describing a number of MMOD strikes, and we just wanted to confirm that number again.",15692.25032,15699.810319999999
Let me see.,15702.43782,15703.37532
I would say I can see eleven from my perspective.,15710.25032,15713.62532
"But because of the, like, raised the grid area, there might be some that I can't see on these spaces.",15714.50032,15720.31282
"And I'm only really counting what I can see on two of the pieces and not really the size, the width of the Alright.",15723.75032,15737.00032
"Copy that, Kayla.",15737.00032,15737.87532
Good words.,15737.87532,15738.50032
And we will come up with a plan if there's an additional inspection that will take once we move it over there to the frame.,15738.50032,15744.62532
Okay.,15746.37532,15746.87532
Taylor.,15747.50032,15748.00032
"Yes, sir.",15748.50032,15749.12532
You could take your right hand and stick it out to the right.,15749.12532,15752.12532
I'll get your right a little bit.,15752.12532,15754.44032

We'll see them later.,15772.25032,15773.62532
Ninety percent done with the move.,15782.37532,15784.00032
Copy.,15784.00032,15784.25032
Copy.,15784.25032,15784.75032
You might have seen a camera peeking out from the bottom of the screen with direction from Tom Marshburn asking Kayla to take a peek.,15791.00032,15797.79532
That looks like we just had a selfie in space.,15798.12532,15801.00032
There we go.,15814.25032,15814.88532
"Before the quick photo, Kayla Barron was communicating with the ground, giving a visual inspection of the outside of the International Space Station.",15816.37532,15822.87532
And we are ready for renewor to GCA to publish to assess the transfer position.,15823.00032,15827.12532

Yeah.,16130.50032,16130.75032
"Well, Now go towards the plate.",16130.75032,16134.75032
The alignment pin is in.,16134.75032,16136.00032
Alright.,16136.00032,16136.50032
It's kind of hovering over the alignment I think I'm in a good position with your direction.,16136.75032,16145.50032
So in GCA?,16145.50032,16146.50032
Copy.,16147.50032,16148.00032
GCA is complete and breaks around.,16148.00032,16150.055419999999

For your direction?,16152.50032,16153.83362
Pull it toward you a little bit.,16153.83362,16156.00032
The alignment pin is in now.,16157.00032,16158.75032
"Now if you can rotate it, so my end comes down.",16159.02046,16161.75032
There you go.,16161.75032,16163.00032
Nice and flush there.,16163.00032,16164.50032
"Didn't feel like it, satisfying.",16165.00032,16167.00032
There's no soft dock if I remember correctly here.,16168.50032,16172.00032
It's just the alignment pincom.,16172.00032,16173.50032
That's right.,16174.25032,16175.00032
And I'm gonna try to see if I can get these both hands started.,16175.00032,16178.50032
K.,16179.50032,16179.75032
Let me is it kinda melted there?,16179.75032,16183.00032
If you could hold it as flush with the frame as possible.,16183.36552,16190.00032
I need to get more left to do that.,16190.77052,16193.50032
Astronauts.,16195.50032,16195.667019999999
Now we're talking about the RAM or the flight reusable attach mechanism.,16195.667019999999,16199.50032
That's what,16200.00032,16200.00052
These replacement parts are attached to and it's how they were brought onto the space station in the first place.,16200.040498027,16204.6177075
"If you recall earlier in the EVA when they removed the degraded SASSA, They temporarily stowed it back onto the express logistics carrier, but now they're doing a more permanent installation of the degraded unit.",16204.8364575,16219.828645
I would be a rather like a NLTCA or GTAs to my left.,16220.047395,16224.984895

No.,16228.09427,16228.297395
It's gonna last twenty centimeters.,16228.297395,16229.672395
Twenty centimeters left?,16230.172395,16231.28177
Seventy.,16231.28177,16231.766145
Seventy.,16231.766145,16232.266145
That's a clear motion.,16232.56302,16235.15677
Ted?,16237.43802,16237.93802
And it's showing centimeters.,16241.46927,16242.56302

"Challenge here is to get these canceled, they're gonna have to be pretty well aligned.",16277.37552,16281.31302
Right.,16281.50052,16282.00052
"So right here is a really good position, I think.",16282.18802,16285.18802
Yeah.,16286.25052,16286.56302
Keep it stable if I remove my hand.,16286.56302,16288.75052
Let me go manual another twenty.,16288.87552,16291.12552

Let me try this in GCA.,16328.37552,16330.00052
Copy.,16331.37552,16331.62552
GCA complete and the brakes are on.,16331.62552,16334.25052
Looks like it was turning.,16346.12552,16347.37552
I'll try the other one first.,16359.00052,16360.50052
Yep.,16360.50052,16361.00052
"EV, I will put down my VRT pump, and that would help us.",16370.37552,16375.50052
Okay.,16375.50052,16376.00052
"Next move would be the move in the arm again to draw more in, like, your position if you do.",16378.25052,16385.37552
I don't have a guarantee.,16397.12552,16398.87552
Alright.,16401.62552,16402.12552
Okay.,16419.50052,16420.00052
Think what?,16420.13052,16420.62552
Let me get I can get into a much better position here if I get some long motion.,16420.62552,16425.87552
Give me one chance to -- Absolutely.,16427.62552,16429.31302
-- try it.,16429.31302,16430.37552
All the chances you need is for one.,16430.62552,16432.50052
The real challenge here.,16441.87552,16443.37552
"A physical hotel, sir, way over the You can see the witness from the prior assays.",16445.13553,16454.75052
Relying just right for that below where it's not oxidized?,16455.50052,16458.50052
Yeah.,16459.00052,16459.25052
I've noticed that too.,16459.25052,16460.50052
"Like, a little outline there.",16460.50052,16462.00052
"You got some engagement there, maybe?",16469.00052,16470.75052
No?,16470.75052,16470.89052
Could are we getting out the ratchet wrench?,16475.50052,16479.00052
Let's see.,16487.00052,16487.50052
"We could have asked if because just try driving it with the p It got some play in it, but it's not just coming all the way up.",16487.50052,16493.50052
"And lift it off, keep my hand on it.",16500.25052,16501.87552
"If you wanna lift it up, just attach it if it comes out.",16501.87552,16504.50052
It's Take your toll.,16506.50052,16508.00052
"You're tracking back out, so I don't think it's engaged.",16508.50052,16511.00052
"But this other one oh, I see.",16511.00052,16512.75052
Yeah.,16512.75052,16513.00052
"The other one is if I was holding it, but it didn't move up there.",16513.00052,16516.75052
Alright.,16518.75052,16519.00052
I can help you a lot more if we do a couple more of the neighbors.,16519.00052,16522.00052

"Tom, I'm thinking that it needs to rotate the left side toward you.",16665.50052,16671.25052
It looks a little left side towards me.,16671.75052,16674.50052
Correct.,16674.50052,16674.75052
Yeah.,16674.75052,16675.00052

Registering by one of them for the hand back on there.,16973.37552,16976.00052
The next thing we could do is is dis stable and maybe hit it with the PGT again.,16981.87552,16986.87552
Think we're just not quite aligned here.,16996.12552,17000.00052

"Oh, man.",17023.62552,17024.00052
I think we're just close to any business.,17024.00052,17026.00052
Found that in there.,17027.00052,17028.12552
"So guys, we've been following along.",17032.62552,17034.12552
"And so one of the suggestions that we had was maybe try, like, Tom and his colleagues, go ahead and engage the PGT on the Bolt And if we need to take put Tom in a better GCA, I'm just in a slightly better position.",17034.12552,17045.62552
And then Kayla has the PGT on.,17045.62552,17047.75052
"And then when we feel it in position, give it that one less than one turn with the at alpha one setting.",17047.75052,17055.12552
Alright.,17055.12552,17055.62552
K.,17059.25052,17059.50052
Sounds good.,17059.50052,17060.00052
So I'm gonna do a quick GTA.,17060.00052,17061.75052
"And rather GTA coming forward, ten centimeters.",17062.50052,17067.50052
Copy.,17068.25052,17068.75052
"Brakes coming off, and I gave you the body four ten centimeters starting motion.",17068.75052,17072.50052
"We just reached the four hour mark into the planned six and a half hour spacewalk with NASA astronauts, Tom Marshburn and Kayla Barron, they are now working to stow the degraded SASSA, this one that failed or part of it went down back in September.",17073.28552,17088.75052
"They replaced it with another unit, and now they're just temp stowing the SASSA onto the frame.",17089.50052,17096.25052
And I'll see if I can rotate it a little bit.,17100.75052,17103.00052
Okay.,17106.00052,17106.25052
Let's go ahead and go for two turns.,17106.25052,17108.00052
"They're discussing now the best way to get this done with their ground IV, Drew Morgan, and the EVA team here in mission control.",17111.50052,17118.25052
"That involves getting their PGT, their pistol grip tool.",17119.00052,17123.50052
It's like a cordless drill in space configured and using astronauts Matias Mauer and Rajachari to get Tom Marshburn in a slightly more advantageous position on the robotic arm.,17123.50052,17137.75052
My name is Will.,17146.11054,17153.69552
If you're in on both.,17157.25052,17158.50052
Alright.,17158.75052,17159.25052
"Good work, Kevin.",17159.25052,17160.25052
"Taylor, we're gonna reset to alpha five clockwise to alpha five clockwise too.",17160.25052,17164.75052
Has the astronauts got directions on their tool configuration from the ground IV?,17167.50052,17172.00052
You are looking at a live view of helmet camera number sixteen belonging to Kayla Baron who are now seeing her point of view on the spacewalk today.,17172.00052,17180.00052
"Copy, Kayla.",17182.75052,17183.25052
And your five and a half to nine turns.,17183.25052,17185.25052
Perfect.,17203.25052,17203.75052
"Easy for me to hit this one, sir.",17203.75052,17205.00052
Do you have a good reach for it?,17205.00052,17206.50052
"That was about eight turns, and I think it torqued out.",17206.50052,17209.40549
Degrees on?,17209.75052,17210.50052
Can you turn the lights?,17210.75052,17212.75052
I'm just gonna put it back on there for you to go and see what again?,17212.75052,17214.91718
I think it's parked out on.,17214.91718,17216.25052
Okay.,17216.25052,17216.75052
So I got a green light.,17217.00052,17218.75052
Returned four point seven pound.,17219.00052,17222.00052
K.,17222.50052,17223.00052
"Standby, Kayla.",17232.50052,17233.12552
We're checking.,17233.12552,17233.37552
"Do you wanna do that one, Tom?",17233.37552,17235.00052
Roger?,17235.75052,17236.00052
Yeah.,17236.00052,17236.25052
How do you feel about your position position?,17236.25052,17238.75052
I think you are probably in a better spot for it.,17238.87552,17241.75052
Okay.,17241.75052,17242.00052
We'll wait for the delta now.,17242.00052,17243.50052
Right.,17243.50052,17244.00052
Thank you.,17246.50052,17247.25052
"Alright, guys.",17248.00052,17248.75052
Standby on the second bolt.,17248.75052,17250.50052
Copy.,17252.00052,17252.50052
Standing by.,17252.50052,17253.25052
Okay.,17260.00052,17260.12552
"On the bolt that we just drove, we're gonna just double check settings alpha five clockwise two, and then we're gonna attempt that bolt one more time.",17260.12552,17268.50052
That's we are expecting a little higher torque.,17268.50052,17270.75052
"Alpha five, clockwise two or six.",17273.25052,17276.25052
"Yep, Kayla.",17284.50052,17284.87552
I'm gonna hit that one again.,17284.87552,17286.00052
We're looking for somewhere on the order of about seven foot pounds.,17286.00052,17289.01047
"At this time, I got a green light, seven twenty three.",17290.75052,17293.50052
Alright.,17296.50052,17296.62552
That's a good info.,17296.62552,17297.50052
Baron now double checking on her work.,17297.50052,17300.00052
She installed the first of the two mast bolts to connect the SASSA to the FRAM to the fliGHt releasable attach mechanism.,17300.00052,17310.00052
Good settings.,17311.75052,17312.25052
Five and a half to nine turns.,17312.25052,17314.00052
Thank you.,17315.50052,17318.00052
One and a half to nine.,17319.00052,17320.50052
"As Kayla Barron drives that second masked bolt to secure it, we'll sometimes get some earth views poking out of her her wrist mirror The International Space Station is about to cross the English channel.",17347.32542,17361.00052
It's probably four and seven turns.,17361.50052,17365.28537
And I I read six point nine on the torque there.,17372.00052,17375.00052
Okay.,17375.00052,17375.167220000003
I'm gonna miss that.,17375.167220000003,17376.00052
Thank you.,17376.00052,17377.00052
Alright.,17378.50052,17379.00052
That's a good install as well.,17380.50052,17382.75052
Okay.,17384.00052,17384.50052
"Alright, Tom.",17385.50052,17387.25052
"For you, we wanted you to assess where you are in your arm position if you needed to do any GCA.",17387.25052,17392.00052
Before we start installing the tent the MLI tent.,17393.00052,17397.00052
And then we're gonna be standing by also for your go,17397.00052,17400.000320000003
Whether we can move ahead with our comm swap or we'll be swapping over to space to ground three.,17400.040298027005,17405.277663800003
That'll be seamless to you.,17405.277663800003,17406.437820000003
"But I will do a comm check there with you guys, but we just wanna hear that you're in a good position with the arm first.",17406.437820000003,17412.555007500003
Okay.,17414.851882500003,17415.351882500003
And I'm gonna need to move around.,17416.219070000003,17418.187820000003
I'll get let's let me just knock the tail off for a second.,17419.297195000003,17423.109695000003
Go to ground.,17423.172195000003,17424.109695000003
Need to worry about this side so much.,17426.437820000003,17427.953445000003
We're gonna be putting in porting service afters on this side in there.,17427.953445000003,17433.281570000003
Yep.,17433.969070000003,17434.469070000003
The folks here in Mission Control confirmed a good installation of the degraded Sassy unit.,17434.500320000003,17438.469070000003
"And what do you guys want, sir?",17438.469070000003,17440.531570000003
"I mean, already, do you want us to fax out the there's other inputs you put in or just go from here?",17440.844070000003,17446.781570000003
"Sir, by doing some of that, that is pottie back.",17447.375320000003,17450.281570000003
Twenty centimeters.,17451.094070000003,17451.844070000003
The particular area where the degraded unit has been successfully installed two does allow the communications antenna to receive heater power.,17462.344070000003,17471.125320000003
Twenty seven meters.,17473.937820000003,17475.062820000003
"Pretty soon, Tom Marshburn will work to reinstall the multilayer insulation MLI.",17477.937820000003,17482.687820000003
Which is another layer of thermal protection for the unit.,17483.000320000003,17485.937820000003
No more if you want.,17487.937820000003,17488.750320000003
So that's the that's the twenty.,17488.750320000003,17490.250320000003
So that's good.,17490.437820000003,17491.375320000003
And I will need It's down a half a meter.,17491.437820000003,17495.812820000003
Good motion.,17499.312820000003,17499.937820000003
And stop motion.,17503.000320000003,17504.187820000003
Copy.,17505.000320000003,17505.312820000003
Stop motion.,17505.312820000003,17506.000320000003
I think that'll do it.,17506.062820000003,17507.437820000003
Can I reach everything?,17509.125320000003,17510.250320000003
"Guys, I'm gonna break in real quick, Kayla.",17511.375320000003,17512.812820000003
We're gonna have you stand by on the MLI tent for just a couple of moments.,17512.812820000003,17516.250320000003
Okay.,17518.125320000003,17518.578445000003
And DCA.,17518.578445000003,17519.484695000003
Okay.,17519.484695000003,17519.937820000003
And DCA.,17519.937820000003,17520.687820000003
And DCA complete.,17522.500320000003,17523.500320000003
Brakes around?,17523.500320000003,17524.125320000003
"And just so you know, I'll I'll I'll need another one over to the right side to get the other quarter turn fastness.",17524.187820000003,17529.500320000003
"So, no, we're good for now.",17529.500320000003,17531.62032
"So, Kayla, what we need is a a thorough inspection of the low gain antenna side of the RXG, the part that you probably weren't able to see while it was in the temp stow location?",17548.875320000003,17557.750320000003
"And if you can grab some photos for us, that will be appreciated as well.",17563.875320000003,17567.500320000003
Bye.,17569.375320000003,17569.875320000003
"And, Tom, for you, if you are in a good position with the GCA and your content with where you're located there.",17574.750320000003,17580.875320000003
What we wanna do is hear your go for the comm swap.,17580.875320000003,17584.090320000003
Alright.,17586.500320000003,17586.875320000003
Let me just check with Matthias and Roger.,17586.875320000003,17588.875320000003
That's good for the comm flap.,17590.125320000003,17591.750320000003
Very good with that.,17593.625320000003,17594.375320000003
Now you had mentioned maybe needing a little more GCA for that other court turn faster.,17594.375320000003,17598.500320000003
"So if you need that first, we're happy to do it.",17598.750320000003,17601.250320000003
"Otherwise, we're we're good.",17601.250320000003,17602.650320000004
Don't be the next step in the shroud installation.,17603.125320000003,17605.875320000003
I can only get one side of it from here.,17606.375320000003,17608.250320000003
I can't get I can't get both sides with one position.,17608.250320000003,17611.750320000003
So If you had the more time with the comm slot.,17611.875320000003,17616.250320000003
Okay.,17617.000320000003,17617.500320000003
"And, Drew, while we're all good with the comm slot at this point, there you gotta go.",17617.750320000003,17621.500320000003
Okay.,17623.250320000003,17623.750320000003
"Tom, we copy.",17624.125320000003,17624.875320000003
And Roger and Matthias know what to do if we lose calm for greater than five minutes.,17624.875320000003,17628.375320000003
"But otherwise, seamless to you.",17628.375320000003,17629.625320000003
I'll check back with you once we're configured.,17629.625320000003,17635.712830000004
"You have lively views now of NASA astronaut, Tom Marsh, burn the bar aboard the robotic arm, working to get that multilayer insulation layer.",17657.500320000003,17666.395320000003
Covered over the antenna.,17666.750320000003,17668.000320000003
Getting live views now from NASA astronaut Kayla Barron's helmet camera on her very first spacewalk of her career as she puts the finishing touches on the stowage of the degraded Sassing unit back onto the express logistics carrier.,17752.750320000003,17769.000320000003
The unit is in good hands attached to heat and getting its nice blanket on.,17769.625320000003,17775.750320000003
"This it's a degraded unit for now, but in the event that they ever want to repair it and use it again, is available for them to do so.",17775.875320000003,17784.000320000003
A new unit to replace the spare did not have to be launched to the International Space Station for this operation.,17795.500320000003,17800.500320000003
As it already lived right here where the degraded unit once was.,17800.595320000004,17804.000320000003
We're in a brief unexpected handover period right now.,17839.750320000003,17842.750320000003
"Meanwhile, aboard outside of the International Space Station, Nasha astronauts, Tom, Marshburn, and Kayla Baron are working to install the multi layer installation.",17842.750320000003,17852.000320000003
This is a big thermal blanket going over the antenna for protection and thermal protection as well.,17852.615320000004,17860.000320000003
They're both on either side of the antenna working to get that fastened.,17861.000320000003,17865.000320000003
These two space walking astronauts launched to the International Space Station as part of the proof three mission just earlier this month and as you can see have already hit the ground running.,17906.250320000003,17915.000320000003
"Today, they worked to install a new SASSA unit was already a part of the International Space Station removing a degraded unit that had gone partially down just this past September.",17915.500320000003,17928.750320000003
"Because of other communications redundancies aboard the International Space Station, this spacewalk was not a huge rush when it went down in September, but now the International Space Station operations has time to do the spacewalk.",17934.000320000003,17947.750320000003
And Kayla Barron and Tom Marshburn have executed it ahead of schedule.,17948.000320000003,17953.750320000003
"Following these finishing touches, NASA astronaut Kayla Barron will work to return the bags of tools and other equipment they would need during the spacewalk that she had originally brought out of the Quest airlock and returned them back.",18001.5999894,18014.297255
"Meanwhile, Tom Marshburn will set to do the steps to of the portable foot restraint in reverse and put them back on the cedar and break free from the robotic arm of the International Space Station and join Kayla Baron back in the quest airlock.",18014.46913,18030.484755
You're looking now at a live view.,18136.12538,18137.62538
"This time from the helmet camera of NASA astronaut, Tom Marshburn.",18137.62538,18141.25038
As he gets that thermal protection covering hooked onto the communications antenna.,18141.62538,18146.62538
"During the installation of the spare sasa, where the degraded unit once was, Kayla Barron had attached some wires that gave the unit power, and Tom Marshburn was able to switch the unit on.",18350.50038,18364.50038
This all occurred before they went to go stow the degraded unit.,18364.50038,18369.62538
We're now hearing that the unit is getting good forward and return communications on the sasa That means that the new sass is functioning as expected.,18369.62538,18378.50038
"If you can't recall, the old one had a failed return link.",18378.87538,18383.71038
"It meant that we could send data up to the space station, but the antenna lost its ability to send signals back to Earth.",18383.75038,18390.25038
"Fortunately, where you've got notification that this brand new Sasa is getting information and communication both ways.",18390.75038,18397.25038
"You're getting a live view now of NASA astronaut, Kayla Barron's helmet camera.",18442.25038,18447.00038
"Her heck of you sees high definition cameras, We're watching this through her perspective as she puts the finishing touches, as she puts the thermal protection over the degraded Sassy unit.",18447.00038,18458.25038
For future integrity.,18458.75038,18460.50038
"While this blanket that you're looking at may look thin, it's actually made up of several layers sewn together of varying materials, including mylar, for the purpose of being able to withstand the swings from hot so cold that the space station experiences several times per day.",18502.50038,18519.00038
So while we're getting information here on the grounds that we're getting good forward and return communications on this newly installed SaaS unit.,18565.820450000003,18577.50038
The crew our space walking crew today is going to do a check of the communications and we might hear Rajatree and Matija Smaurik confirm whether or not they hear it.,18577.75038,18588.75038
"In addition to these voice checks, the space walking astronauts are also going to check out their own equipment.",18607.9730962,18613.03169
I'm gonna do a hat check and glove inspection as you've heard them do several times throughout the spacewalk.,18613.25044,18618.31294
This is just one more step before they go back into the Quest airlock to conclude the EBA.,18618.453565,18623.18794
Houston station space.,18633.56294,18634.93794
You got one out of here.,18634.93794,18636.28169
"Station Houston, the fifth round one, read you loud and clear.",18642.56294,18645.78169
Let's move to two.,18645.84419,18646.93794
You're seeing the camera views of NASA astronauts Kayla Barron.,18688.43794,18691.31294
"And if you look at the top of your screen, you can briefly see some red stripes falling into Tom Marshburn.",18691.31294,18696.00044
"Right now, they're confirming with the ground that the thermal insulation is where it needs to be.",18696.31294,18701.25044
See what's going on because of my Yeah.,18760.12544,18763.00044
And that's not But they should adhere.,18763.00044,18766.00044
"Oh, I see.",18766.37544,18767.25044
Yeah.,18767.87544,18768.12544
The the the there's no pro inside the plan shell that should adhere to the test.,18768.12544,18772.87544
"And from what I can tell, That's quite flat.",18773.75044,18780.25044
Right.,18781.87544,18782.37544
"Like my end, we come Towards the Station aft?",18782.37544,18787.12544
Yes.,18788.00044,18788.50044
It seems to go down a little bit.,18789.75044,18791.75044
You're now hearing the voice of Kayla Baron.,18792.00044,18794.00044
"Went quiet for a little while because she had switched over from space to ground to another method of communication to test out the SASSA, and we confirmed that those communications checks were good.",18794.62544,18808.00044
Good the good news that we have a working staff at Tennant.,18808.75044,18811.50044
Antenna.,18811.50044,18812.00044
Great job.,18812.00044,18812.75044
That's fantastic.,18815.00044,18815.87544
Awesome.,18816.25044,18816.75044
Congratulations.,18817.12544,18817.62544
That's great.,18820.37544,18821.12544
What do you see in time in the field?,18824.62544,18826.31294
On the gas.,18826.50044,18827.25044
"The Clear Channel is not completely closed, but it's As Tom, Marshburn and Caleb Baron put the finishing touches on the thermal insulation.",18828.50044,18837.75044
"Here in Mission Control Houston, we got a couple of cheers, hearing the good news that the sasa is working function working and functioning fine.",18838.75044,18847.62544
Shows not mating with the Velcro.,18848.50044,18850.62544
They need to go aft further.,18851.37544,18853.62544
"So it needs to go aft, but rotation doesn't matter.",18853.62544,18857.75044
Right?,18857.75044,18858.25044
I don't think so.,18858.35542,18859.75044
There's a tab on my side -- Okay.,18859.75044,18861.87544
-- that's a belt lined up.,18861.87544,18863.50044
So it and the opening should be facing you exactly.,18864.00044,18868.00044
Spacing Venus?,18868.31041,18869.25044
Yeah.,18869.25044,18869.75044
So what I would recommend is opening it back up and releasing it.,18870.25044,18875.7454
And then trying to get it further aft before we close it.,18876.00044,18879.50044
"The top of the clamps though, it's really flush hard against the top of the height gain.",18880.50044,18887.75044
Okay.,18887.75044,18888.25044
Then sounds like a good config.,18888.25044,18890.00044
I'll push the MOI probably a little bit further up.,18890.00044,18893.28541
Need it?,18893.28541,18893.75044
The little turtleneck light has been in the way.,18893.75044,18895.87544
So let me look that up a little bit.,18895.87544,18899.75044
And then the turtleneck piece is the lack of a better word.,18905.50044,18909.00044
"I'm looking pretty good right there, Thomas.",18909.00044,18910.94542
Close it.,18911.00044,18911.75044
Okay.,18911.75044,18912.25044
I think the the little flap was in the way.,18913.75044,18916.87544
We're trying to close it now.,18916.87544,18918.50044
Think you're in there.,18919.76042,18926.69166
Too much better on my side in terms of alignment.,18928.75044,18931.00044
There we go.,18931.00044,18931.75044
That's a lot better on this side right now too.,18931.75044,18933.75044
Yep.,18933.75044,18934.00044
So I'm sorry.,18934.00044,18935.75044
"That's good, Tom.",18935.75044,18936.75044
Okay.,18938.00044,18938.25044
One done.,18938.25044,18938.62544
Yeah.,18938.62544,18938.75044

Okay.,18940.25044,18940.75044
There's one.,18943.50044,18944.25044
Two.,18951.75044,18952.25044
That holds it.,18955.75044,18956.75044
Okay.,18960.50044,18961.00044
Looks pretty good.,18962.25044,18963.25044

Everything looks good on my end.,18983.00044,18984.67039
"And if you don't mind y'all in just a little bit double check your safety SAFER handles, that one looks good on your if you look y'all on your left.",18984.75044,18992.5254
"And it can't quite see that one, actually.",18995.50044,18998.75044
I could see that one on your left hand.,18998.87544,19001.00044

And to prevent both damage.,21140.625559999997,21142.125559999997

"And you got a little broken up there at the end, Drew?",21154.000559999997,21157.250559999997
I would say I've turned about a half turn with the ratchet wrench.,21158.125559999997,21161.375559999997

This was attached to the robotic arm that connected his feet for the majority of the EVA.,21206.500559999997,21211.750559999997
It's not a depressible.,21211.750559999997,21216.000559999997

Okay.,21322.000559999997,21322.500559999997
And then I'll probably roll it around.,21323.500559999997,21329.250559999997
Right?,21329.250559999997,21329.750559999997
"Because it's in a low profile position now, but I flip around the clock and then redo the pitch.",21329.750559999997,21335.500559999997
"Not the pitch, but the roll.",21337.000559999997,21339.000559999997
"And it'll be in the low power as well, but I'll copy.",21339.490609999997,21342.750559999997

"And can I just confirm, Drew, I never released h two with the ratchet?",21407.750559999997,21411.750559999997
Was that is that correct?,21413.000559999997,21415.000559999997

This connected him to the robotic arm conducted by Matias Mauer and Rajachari.,21528.500559999997,21534.500559999997
This means that cleanup of their work site is pretty much all complete.,21535.000559999997,21539.000559999997

"So for instance, if you call out alpha five c w two, it means moderate torque value going in the direction clockwise with a speed of two, so perfectly in the middle between one and three.",21623.859934999997,21635.188059999997
Checking.,21642.594309999997,21643.094309999997

I know you've studied the pictures of this.,22584.2505,22585.8755
"I can give you any words, but, you know, that big one is gonna go through the tunnel there and then put three twists on it.",22585.8755,22591.620529999997
Switching now to live views for NASH astronaut Kala Bearness.,22643.7505,22646.3755
She works on a couple of get ahead tasks.,22646.3755,22648.5005
Before the conclusion of the space walk.,22648.7505,22651.2505
She's braking torque or loosening a couple of the bolts on a couple of different locations on the space station.,22651.5005,22656.7505
"Again, not related to this sasa, but could one day be helpful in case we ever need spares?",22658.0005,22663.2505
Did you hear about the wire ties through the yes.,22768.0005,22771.2106
"Upper strength tunnels, both of them, and I got three halves with.",22771.5005,22776.0005
"Okay, Kayla.",22780.2656,22782.2505
That looks good.,22782.2505,22783.0005
"And, you know, the second wire tag goes on that micro fixtures.",22783.0005,22786.0005
They're adjacent.,22786.0005,22787.0005
I'm sure it doesn't work.,22787.7505,22790.1606
And I found the,22790.1606,22800.0006
Looking on battery to the onboard side.,22800.72032656,22804.3170062
Correct?,22804.3170062,22804.8170062
Affirmative.,22806.3990375,22806.8990375
"After completing her task to break torque, Kayla Barron is now working on her second get ahead task.",22872.0006,22877.8756
"This involves putting wire ties on the sub or solar array blanket boxes, and that's what you see her tying now.",22878.0631,22884.9381
K.,22888.6256,22888.8131
I've got it secured.,22888.8131,22889.8756

"Copy, Kayla.",22895.8756,22896.5006
And so now we're gonna take that wire tie that you just placed And we wanted to go across that cable connection there.,22896.5006,22902.7506
"So it's kind of capturing it, depressing it down, and then use that wire to then grab the lasso that you just did on the on the side itself.",22902.7506,22911.8131
Exactly.,22912.1881,22912.5631
And it's hard.,22912.5631,22917.0631
How far do you expect these to rotate after?,22930.5006,22932.8756
Sorry?,22935.5006,22936.0006
Checking.,22938.8756,22939.3756

I don't know.,22944.5006,22945.2506
Thirty degrees away from straight up.,22947.5006,22951.1256
It's hot.,22954.6256,22955.2506
Yeah.,22955.7506,22956.0006
"Taylor, we want it to clear.",22956.0006,22957.3756
"It's a meeting, sir.",22957.3756,22958.5006
We want it to rotate all the way against that hard stuff like you have it exactly closest to the micro square.,22959.1256,22964.2506
So you you are doing it exactly correct.,22964.2506,22966.5006
And let me get this cable underneath.,22968.5006,22970.2506
"Yeah, Kayla.",22992.2506,22992.8756
And so that ORU just off to your right is the PFCS and wanna be able to get at that robotically.,22992.8756,22998.6256
And so your tieback is gonna give us clear access to it.,22998.7506,23002.6256
In a reposition where I have the attachment point here if I can just because I realize that's fine.,23005.7506,23014.0006
For tight.,23014.7506,23015.3756
Drew.,23086.0006,23086.5006
Got an idea for you guys.,23087.5006,23089.0006
Would it be okay to try each two wire tie under the loop wire tie and then tighten it back that way.,23089.7506,23100.0006
"Yep, Kayla.",23101.0006,23101.5006
"That's exactly what we want you to do, then double it back, and then add three twists.",23101.5006,23105.5006
Okay.,23105.5006,23106.0006
"Picture I kind of remembered the end being connected, but I think things better.",23109.5006,23115.7506
My standpoint right now.,23117.0006,23118.7506
I was one of her get ahead test NASA astronaut Kayla Barron.,23120.5006,23124.0006
Is working to install a set of two long wire ties to the solar array blanket boxes.,23124.29058,23130.0006
Drew got it restrained back.,23143.2506,23145.0006
And I will try to tell me if you can see it in my third EVS.,23146.0006,23149.5006

Yeah.,24739.375779999995,24739.875779999995

Thank you.,24745.625779999995,24746.250779999995
I'm gonna get up into position to go tail and get that.,24786.000779999995,24788.875779999995
Getting a live view now at the feet of astronaut Tom Marshburn as he makes his way back into the airlock.,24857.500779999995,24864.250779999995
"NASA astronaut Kayla Barron, his space walking colleague for the day is already inside was working to stow some of the bags that she brought in full of the tools.",24864.750779999995,24874.750779999995
All primary tasks were complete today to replace a faulty communications antenna and replace it with a functioning one.,24875.500779999995,24885.250779999995
"And in addition, all of their get ahead tasks are complete.",24885.250779999995,24888.500779999995
I got some pictures.,24889.000779999995,24890.000779999995
Much appreciated.,24894.000779999995,24894.750779999995
Come on here.,24904.250779999995,24905.250779999995
"And, son, that's all we needed.",24905.500779999995,24907.000779999995
You can hit on him?,24907.250779999995,24908.575729999993
K.,24912.000779999995,24912.500779999995
New York.,24912.500779999995,24913.250779999995
Yeah.,24913.250779999995,24913.375779999995
I'd love to get something there.,24913.375779999995,24914.750779999995
"That might be you, Kayla.",24914.750779999995,24915.750779999995
"Oh, No.",24915.750779999995,24918.750779999995
So there we go.,24918.750779999995,24919.250779999995
What's your SDU?,24919.250779999995,24920.250779999995
"It's not for a second, Paul?",24920.500779999995,24922.250779999995
Your SDU was caught on your foot.,24922.500779999995,24924.750779999995
Yeah.,24924.750779999995,24925.250779999995
And no.,24928.250779999995,24928.875779999995
You're good.,24928.875779999995,24929.250779999995
Gail?,24929.250779999995,24929.750779999995
Gail?,24932.250779999995,24932.750779999995
I have the bags right here.,24934.270709999993,24937.250779999995
"So if they're in your way, please spell.",24937.250779999995,24939.750779999995
Okay.,24940.000779999995,24940.500779999995
Let's snap that throttle cover right back.,24944.250779999995,24946.000779999995
It bounces back to me.,24946.000779999995,24951.000779999995
Barron and Marshburn now working together to configure both their bodies and their equipment into the airlock.,24956.250779999995,24962.000779999995
So that repressurization can begin.,24962.250779999995,24964.500779999995
Yeah.,24967.250779999995,24967.500779999995
That's in work.,24967.500779999995,24968.500779999995
Yeah.,24969.500779999995,24969.750779999995
Verbal coverage.,24969.750779999995,24970.500779999995
Let me come with that.,24970.500779999995,24971.630719999994
There we go.,24990.250779999995,24991.250779999995
McDonald's closed.,24993.500779999995,24994.500779999995
"The person you see on screen now is NASA astronaut Mark Vanda Hai, and sometimes we'll see astronaut Raj Chitari floating into view as well.",24997.500779999995,25005.750779999995
"They're the suit IVs for today's operation, helping Barron and Marshburn get in and out of their space suits.",25005.750779999995,25011.750779999995
And if you can verify for us that the magnet actually engaged.,25015.750779999995,25019.000779999995
Okay.,25024.000779999995,25024.500779999995
Okay.,25024.500779999995,25025.000779999995
I gotta release it all the way.,25028.835739999995,25036.125779999995
It's your hand in there to Please hold.,25036.125779999995,25046.500779999995
And my s u is connected and locked.,25061.250779999995,25063.750779999995
"Copy, Caleb.",25066.500779999995,25067.500779999995
And I had a weird angle that you're working it?,25083.250779999995,25087.000779999995
You're seeing the suited up gloves of NASA not Tom Marshburn as designated by the number twenty two in the corner.,25109.905809999997,25122.000779999995
We're getting his perspective as he tries to get the door closed.,25122.000779999995,25125.500779999995
Hello?,25157.500779999995,25158.000779999995
Two three.,25171.500779999995,25172.500779999995
The view you're looking at is the thermal cover of the Quest airlock.,25174.695779999995,25180.000779999995
"Once Tom Marshburn gets that closed, then they could work to close the hatch.",25180.500779999995,25184.750779999995
That thermal cover just an extra layer of protection for the hatch door from the elements of space.,25184.750779999995,25191.000779999995
"The EVA does not conclude once the door is closed, but when the space suits are back off of internal battery power.",25191.155749999994,25199.000779999995
"Just not a strong enough magnet, doesn't say what?",25201.119860599996,25203.498766899997
Copy.,25209.828844999996,25210.328844999996
"Copy, Tom.",25210.594469999996,25211.492907499996
And we'll just ask that you make sure to give your best effort in getting the magnet engaged and then cinch it up to six.,25212.071032499996,25218.406969999996
Black lines on that tail.,25218.969469999996,25220.516344999996
I've got six.,25224.047594999996,25224.766344999996
There's still a bit of a gap.,25224.766344999996,25226.115717999997
About the limit of the adjustable.,25226.953844999996,25229.172594999996
"And, yeah, the magnet is not engaging.",25230.594469999996,25233.688219999996
Yeah.,25235.719469999996,25236.000719999996
Let's fix on it for just a second and then pops right off.,25236.000719999996,25239.938219999996
"Get Pretty close to me, however.",25242.188219999996,25244.500719999996
Yeah.,25244.750719999996,25245.094469999996
I'm looking at about five inch gap.,25245.094469999996,25247.438219999996
A four inch gap.,25248.750719999996,25249.844469999996
Is the medium low or you guys behind the camera?,25268.500719999996,25270.938219999996
It is.,25273.313219999996,25273.938219999996
"Oh, I see.",25274.625719999996,25275.031969999996
Hear you.,25275.188219999996,25275.750719999996
"Oh, that was your feet.",25275.750719999996,25276.625719999996
Okay.,25276.625719999996,25277.125719999996
That was just still down in there.,25277.813219999996,25279.625719999996
"Tom, we were wondering if you could try to manipulate a little bit because we think that it's flexing away so the magnet doesn't quite engage.",25289.125719999996,25296.563219999996
And do you want me to do?,25302.313219999996,25303.813219999996
Yeah.,25309.500719999996,25310.000719999996
"Because it's sort of, like, full of us all the way tight.",25310.563219999996,25313.250719999996
It won't go in.,25313.813219999996,25314.875719999996
Okay.,25317.438219999996,25317.813219999996
So maybe I'll send out the middle of it.,25317.813219999996,25319.500719999996
You mean you mean?,25319.500719999996,25320.470709999998
The guess was the size that'll go.,25326.625719999996,25328.500719999996
We're not pulling the when we get all the way up.,25329.125719999996,25335.625719999996
Yeah.,25336.750719999996,25337.000719999996
So I'm gonna cover up.,25337.000719999996,25338.070719999996
"Tom, if you hold with your left hand as you are and then push on the middle with your right hand, Yeah.",25341.375719999996,25350.625719999996
Hit that.,25350.750719999996,25351.500719999996
I'll push it on the ribs with my right hand.,25358.000719999996,25359.875719999996
"Well, I'll take a look.",25359.875719999996,25363.125719999996
And we're now letting go.,25365.750719999996,25367.625719999996
It just simply got enough magnetic force as you see it bend in the Bear up again.,25368.250719999996,25374.625719999996
Checking.,25381.250719999996,25381.750719999996
I've got all the rips.,25385.625719999996,25386.875719999996
It's out.,25387.625719999996,25388.500719999996
Please type in the mail.,25389.000719999996,25390.125719999996
Okay.,25390.125719999996,25390.625719999996
It's staying intact intact now.,25398.875719999996,25400.750719999996
This doesn't barely release it.,25402.875719999996,25405.875719999996
So it's all the way up now.,25405.875719999996,25407.300739999995
Alright.,25410.000719999996,25410.250719999996
"Tom, we like it.",25410.250719999996,25411.000719999996
Very light touch to pop it off.,25411.125719999996,25412.875719999996
Yep.,25413.125719999996,25413.625719999996
We're gonna go with it.,25413.875719999996,25414.875719999996
It looks good.,25414.875719999996,25415.725739999998
"And we're gonna go ahead and have you remove your SCU from its pouch, open your DCM cover, and then connect and verify that we are connected and locked.",25415.750719999996,25423.000719999996
Okay.,25429.500719999996,25430.000719999996
Marshburne confirms that the hatch thermal cover is closed.,25446.875719999996,25450.250719999996
He worked with the brown to make sure that it laid flush and stayed closed.,25450.875719999996,25455.375719999996
See the pouch.,25456.500719999996,25457.250719999996
I think my when this is a little bit against yours and looks at it around the other way.,25457.250719999996,25462.000719999996
Got it.,25495.000719999996,25495.750719999996
"Was going, Kayla?",25564.750719999996,25565.750719999996
I'm connected.,25565.875719999996,25567.000719999996
I'm connected as well.,25567.250719999996,25568.750719999996

You're both connected to your SDUs and they're locked in place.,25573.750719999996,25576.250719999996
I have a note for you here.,25576.250719999996,25577.690779999997
We'd recommend the TCV setting between eight and max cold versus dial towards your feet when we go to our next couple of steps.,25578.000719999996,25587.000719999996
Okay.,25591.250719999996,25591.750719999996

Gotcha.,25597.000719999996,25597.500719999996
Checking it.,25599.500719999996,25600.250719999996
"Okay, guys.",25604.500719999996,25605.000719999996
It's time to go water switches off.,25605.000719999996,25606.750719999996
You can expect an h two off message.,25606.750719999996,25609.250719999996
I'm at eight and going from my water switch.,25613.000719999996,25615.000719999996
My water switch is off.,25615.000719999996,25616.500719999996
I have the h two with all sensors.,25616.500719999996,25618.250719999996
"Mine is off, and I got the water as well as message.",25619.000719999996,25621.500719999996
Okay.,25623.000719999996,25623.500719999996
That starts our two minute timer.,25623.500719999996,25625.000719999996
"Barron and Marshburn are now moving through the final steps of their ingress procedures, including turning their water off They're soon gonna verify that the hatch is clear and ready to be closed.",25630.750719999996,25643.000719999996
And that's where it's clear.,25650.250719999996,25651.750719999996
And then you can verify also that the handle position is per decal.,25654.500719999996,25658.250719999996
It says for the decal.,25666.000719999996,25667.500719999996
Alright.,25669.500719999996,25669.750719999996

"Hey, Drew.",25720.795889999998,25725.493419999995

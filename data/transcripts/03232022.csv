Copy your plan to work the anchor hooks.,4286.799995,4288.82
"Your anchor hook goes aft, and Matias's anchor hook goes forward.",4288.88,4292.74
That could work.,4294.56,4295.46
K.,4301.345,4301.744995
"And the white Look, egg hook labeled two.",4301.744995,4305.19
"Is it AT and T as in egg hook is locked, lock on lock on the floor, they locked you.",4305.490005,4310.05
Right?,4310.05,4310.450005
"With that, T as hard as this low pass, This disconnect your waist tether appears for the airlock d ring extender.",4310.450005,4316.16499
I'll just start working on the side here.,4316.16499,4318.024994
Good night.,4318.16499,4318.645
I'll switch it.,4318.645,4319.625
I'm taking off my left.,4325.11,4326.96999
Wake further from the ceiling extent of yellow.,4327.509995,4330.48999
"And, Roger, can you report the config of EV one safety tether?",4334.615,4338.555
That's the e d one.,4341.21,4343.21
My e d one white peg hook marked e d one single is on the hatch d ring.,4343.21,4347.85
That's the lock d ring.,4347.85,4349.31
Copy that.,4351.11499,4351.595
And we had a short handover.,4351.595,4352.89499
"We may have, missed that.",4352.955,4354.155
Thank you.,4354.155,4354.89499
"So I can see the camera bag I think the red is wrapped around some of the things on my right side, so I'm trying to find what it's wrapped on.",4363.74,4370.66501
And let's see if my SAFEER will definitely deploy.,4393.07,4396.99
So that's what was caught on.,4396.99,4398.45
"So Oh, yeah.",4399.31,4400.385
It's clear.,4400.385,4401.045
I see.,4402.385,4403.025
That's what that one was wrapped around.,4403.025,4404.885
Okay.,4405.825,4406.325
Are we fixed it outside?,4409.12001,4410.5
While I'm trying to get the bag can you get the bag inside?,4411.36,4413.52
It'll be definitely worth the safer handle outside.,4413.52,4415.46
"But, don't I'll just obviously be careful.",4417.345,4419.105
I can't see what it's attached to you back there.,4419.105,4421.525
And can you y'all next?,4421.825,4423.925
"Oh, it's a code.",4425.46,4426.68001
It's exciting.,4426.74,4427.46
We don't train the handle.,4427.46,4428.84
"Grab back over there and push it, like, towards your body forward left.",4447.625,4452.36499
Put your body forward left.,4454.825,4456.11
That might clear some scraper handle.,4456.11,4458.12997
"Otherwise, I need to come out.",4458.59,4460.37
I'm close to you.,4461.55,4462.84998

"The next, let me move from the actual to a handrail here so you can't move.",4495.22,4499.08002
You're clear to come out.,4510.15,4511.37
I think I'm trying the same trick right here.,4532.25,4534.395
What's the center code on me?,4535.51498,4537.13498
Okay.,4537.51498,4538.01498
Coming out.,4538.07498,4538.815

Yeah.,4625.835,4626.155
And then we can sort out the bag and then the safe handle.,4626.155,4629.055
"And, Roger Matias, we concur with that.",4629.79,4632.67
"We like, having you egress get untangled.",4632.67,4635.49
"We'll actually work with the safer handle first, and then, we'll do the back ops.",4635.79,4639.41
Okay.,4641.425,4641.925
I don't know if we can get the handle back in with that bag wrapped around it though.,4641.985,4646.00497

So now Do you need to come down to me?,4681.405,4683.84
Yep.,4683.84,4684.0
Or to try to do is rotate all the stuff out of the way so I don't interfere with you.,4684.0,4688.56
And I think I can stabilize my body That would be the way I would be placing this way and have turned my savers handled towards you.,4688.56,4696.035

Is reengaged.,5489.695,5490.355
They're both not forced to drive.,5490.815,5492.355
"Now I need to see if we can try to engage perfection, stuff to hold for you for the next step, but I do wanna try to reinstate the actual locks on the helmet?",5492.735,5501.72
Or come up with a wire tie solution?,5504.965,5506.585
Checking.,5512.97,5513.47
Okay.,5519.21,5519.61
Left and right golfers engaged.,5519.61,5521.229996
I'm gonna try and put on you again to see if since you'd like it.,5522.475,5525.134995
"Alright, Ashley.",5556.58499,5557.14499
This is anymore.,5557.14499,5557.58499
I'm also thinking maybe I should find something to rent to on those helmet.,5557.58499,5561.245
"So if it does come off, so I'm trying to reattach it, it doesn't they don't lose it.",5561.305,5565.485
"And, Roger Matias, we're continuing to talk about it.",5566.17,5569.12999
"Also, we like how you've rotted the strap.",5569.12999,5571.23
"What we propose is that you close the thermal cover continue with buddy checks while we discuss, any further work on the on the helmet camera.",5571.37,5580.825
Looks like the magnets only are closed.,5588.53,5590.12999
Yep.,5590.12999,5590.62999
Our astronauts are now working to close the hatch thermal cover.,5592.595,5595.895
"Alright, buddy.",5596.515,5597.41501
Alright.,5599.52,5599.84
I'll start on you.,5599.84,5600.64
I can see you.,5600.64,5601.52
"Coming up soon, they'll perform a series of buddy checks checking out each other's space suits and making sure all is well.",5601.52,5607.06
One.,5607.195,5607.695
Two.,5608.315,5608.815
"If you y'all body locked, I can see the other tab.",5609.35501,5613.13501
"One two three tabs up, and both your saver handles are down.",5616.89,5620.59001
Copy.,5621.85,5622.35
At least that means a good use.,5623.37001,5624.99
And your crew lock bag is behind two down by your left side.,5628.775,5633.83
So it looks like it's a good config.,5633.83,5635.37
I see your tether path running up to the forward left view range.,5635.67,5641.61
So I'm gonna try to see it.,5643.335,5644.855
K.,5644.855,5644.935
"It does close, light on black.",5644.935,5646.635
But I'm alright.,5646.775,5647.975
"Right now, your, your waist tether runs up through your tether back, but as soon as you disconnect Yes.",5647.975,5653.17
"Once you get that down, we'll I can work on your other waste tether.",5665.39502,5668.295
Now your other waist tether like you mentioned before is wrapped around the knuckle of your BRT.,5674.68002,5679.1
"So if you take your left waist tether anchor hook off your ready workstation, You're getting a view now of the tethers that our spacewalkers, Rajatarian, Matiams, ma'am, are discussing.",5679.485,5692.42
Yes.,5697.04498,5697.44498
That one.,5697.44498,5698.26498
And then run it under your BRT and back to you.,5700.16498,5702.32498
There you go.,5702.32498,5703.145
Alright.,5706.92,5707.42
Alright.,5716.095,5716.595
You're looking very for a space lock other than helmet light.,5717.055,5719.79498
Okay.,5722.32,5722.82
Are you ready for check the problem?,5724.88,5726.48
It's only where you give me the booth.,5726.48,5728.18
I see Green.,5729.44,5732.365
I would like six.,5732.365,5734.125
Great view of NASA astronaut Rajuachari now who you see in the red stripes with the Earth below.,5734.125,5739.345
Charlie is assisting matthias Marr to make sure that his tethers are configured correctly.,5739.80002,5743.82
"See three mini workstation caps, and breaker handles are both down now.",5748.225,5755.65
"And the, puller back bumper It's nicely on your left, and I think you can easily manage it.",5756.93,5766.345
"In your safety tether, I see that the AD one tru hook is actually attached to the aft, be ready on the airlock.",5768.005,5776.16998
It's rear twenty three.,5776.87,5777.90997
It's unlocked.,5777.90997,5778.56998
"And I see that, can you show me the small hook?",5778.87,5781.93
It's locked.,5783.555,5784.275
Yeah.,5784.275,5784.51498
It's locked.,5784.51498,5785.07498
It's locked.,5785.07498,5785.475
It's in the ceiling extender.,5785.475,5787.01498
And the other safety tethers are routed on the right and clear.,5788.115,5791.495
Copy.,5791.6,5791.92
Thank you.,5791.92,5792.4
"It's one more vent, which is on your PGT, which is locked out.",5792.4,5796.58002
"You might unload it so that, you don't smoke it.",5796.72,5799.78
Thank you.,5810.94,5811.68
Alright.,5812.13998,5812.63998
I think that's buddy checks complete.,5814.62,5816.06
I have a for a baseline half jacket to drive my gloves.,5816.06,5819.03998
Do not have any new sludges on them from when we started?,5820.18503,5823.08502
"And the same for EDU, my hub is dry, and my bluff to fifteen, like, from from the study.",5825.30502,5833.84
Right.,5841.785,5842.025
And stay on the line with the helmet.,5842.025,5843.385
"I would minimize your movement for now, if you'd because your filter just held on, my thumb throw Roger Matias, copy all.",5843.385,5859.80502
"And, we are ready.",5860.185,5862.445
"Good buddy checks and copy your half and baseline gloves, we're still discussing the hecka.",5863.30502,5868.68
Copy.,5870.74,5871.24
Trying to see what might be a good position for me to work on this.,5875.915,5878.715
I'm thinking stay on my head real here.,5878.715,5882.07498
"I guess behind you in between the wagon wheel back here, I might be able to Yeah.",5882.07498,5886.96
It's I tried myself in there enough to work on it.,5887.02,5891.19998
I captured your parts that came off.,5901.61002,5903.47
"I'm this way, a little bit more.",5906.495,5912.695
"I'll see if I can see the latch, because it's back there.",5912.695,5915.075
"And, Kiela, I'll defer to you.",5930.885,5931.925
"Obviously, you guys know the crib sheet bought ID as I can rent.",5931.925,5934.825
"Good day, sir.",5934.91003,5935.65
"Cable by pointing out with my left hand, and then drive and work it back on the latches.",5935.71,5940.11005
"That way, if I've missed, at least I got a rep to it.",5940.11005,5942.445
But we'll standby for your words.,5942.765,5944.545
"And, Roger Matias, we're still talking about it, but what we're thinking is using a wire tie to keep, Matias's, to better secure Matias's helmet camera.",5946.6849999999995,5957.87
But we're still discussing.,5957.87,5958.99
"Standby, please.",5958.99,5959.89
Okay.,5960.11,5960.61
Alright.,5960.99,5961.47
Awesome.,5961.47,5961.97
"You just heard ground IV Stephanie Wilson relayed to the crew that they're working on a fix, for Matias' And also Tell my camera.",5965.45496,5974.23
Your assessment.,5974.3099999999995,5974.95
"Do you think using a wire tie is, something that you can perform?",5974.95,5979.29
I can't.,5982.255,5983.13495
What what am I wired high at two?,5983.13495,5985.3150000000005
Like the visor knob or something like that?,5990.32996,5993.05
Or do I have to look for something or attach it to?,5993.05,5995.38995
And we,5999.07495,6000.0
"Some initial thoughts, but, let me let me get the final plan.",6000.0,6004.26
Okay.,6006.16,6006.66
Alright.,6069.14,6069.64
That's my BRT here while we have some time.,6070.26,6072.44
You want me?,6074.935,6075.835
"Oh, no.",6076.055,6076.295
I thought it's wrong.,6076.295,6076.935
I'm just putting it higher up on my body so I can get to it later.,6076.935,6079.995
"Roger Matias, we're still discussing.",6087.62,6089.96
"We do have some, steps that we're pulling together.",6090.5,6093.385
We appreciate your patience.,6093.445,6094.825005
"You can hang out for a bit, and, perhaps, get some good photography.",6095.365005,6099.705
Okay.,6102.39,6102.89
"What the crew is working through now is a camera and helmet light assembly that just doesn't wanna stay secured into place the ground right now is working a solution, possibly using some wire ties, but still talking amongst themselves on a solution, Basically, they just don't want to interfere with the space suits or the ability for the space walkers, life support units to get in the way or anything to be compromised there.",6136.48,6160.01
"As soon as we have a fix, our space walkers will be on their way to the work site.",6160.135,6164.635
"You're getting a live view of the Quest airlock with two space walkers, Rajatari, and the space suit with red stripes.",6307.78,6314.285
"You can see his legs poking out there, and European Space Agency astronaut Matias Mar.",6314.285,6319.585
They began their space walk and are getting ready to go out to their worksite.,6320.76498,6326.51
"But first, the crew here on the ground is working on a solution to Matias Mars, camera and helmet light assembly, kind of keeping it in place before they head off.",6326.51,6336.325
Mister Zulu?,6402.18,6402.91998
Yes.,6412.85,6413.09
I think so.,6413.09,6413.73
It could be.,6413.73,6414.63
"Raja Matias, just checking in.",6519.88,6521.80005
"We're still, working as the plan is coming together.",6521.80005,6524.2
I should be back with you shortly.,6524.2,6525.66003
"A solution to the loose camera and helmet light assembly, part of the helmet section of the space suit.",6617.269999,6623.449999
Firmative Smower is in work with the ground crew here.,6623.744999,6626.965
"Our next step is to hear from our ground IV, basically the capcom of a spacewalk NASA astronaut Stephanie Wilson.",6627.265,6633.88
It's expected to give some words to the crew once they're ready.,6634.02,6637.16
"Roger Matias, the plan has come together.",6645.945,6648.105
Thank you for your patience.,6648.105,6649.35
"So what I'd like to do is, kind of read the steps as a big picture, get your comments and assessment, and then we can step through it.",6649.51,6657.21
Okay.,6659.405,6659.905
"And the plan includes, using two long wire ties, Roger, from your BRT.",6660.205,6665.105
So you're gonna use those wire ties to secure to the safer towers.,6665.63,6670.53
You drop one end of the wire tie around the right eHIP gimbal while Matias attempts to hold the EMU TV eHIP assembly onto his helmet.,6672.19,6681.424995
The tie down the tie down should not should minimize imping impingement into the thruster areas.,6682.31,6688.01
"And the preference is to route around the vertical, safer tower to minimize the possibility of the wire tie sliding toward the thrusters.",6688.525,6695.425
Then you'll wrap the open end of the wire tie around the safer around the safer tower.,6696.17,6700.83
So read that back to earth.,6708.065,6710.485
I think you said I'm going basically to go long wire tie and going around a gimbal.,6711.1,6718.08
And then down to the saver tower.,6720.035,6722.215004
"And what I didn't, which plan was that you're talking about the vertical part of the tower?",6722.515,6726.295
Right.,6731.56,6732.06
"And the SAFER tower, it's kind of at the it's an upside down out.",6732.36,6736.86
"So you'll be wrapping the other end of the wire tie around the, horizontal portion and keeping it clear of any thrusters.",6736.895,6746.47
Okay.,6750.77,6751.17001
"I think I If that's all, almost following the same routing as the Velcro, essentially.",6751.17001,6755.735
Yeah.,6759.795,6760.03499
That's correct.,6760.03499,6760.75499
I would just compare it.,6760.75499,6761.875
Yeah.,6761.875,6762.14
Okay.,6762.78,6763.28
Alright.,6763.9,6764.38
I will start putting that in work.,6764.38,6765.98
"I'll work on his right side first, and How did you find whatever a stable position is for you guys and kinda push around and you won't move?",6765.98,6776.775
Yeah.,6776.83499,6777.155
I have a stable position.,6777.315,6778.535
Okay.,6778.595,6779.095
But I'll try to make sure I still Probably kinda used you to translate on them or to to brace myself as I'm doing this.,6779.99,6793.125
Yep.,6793.125,6793.625
Ground IV Stephanie Wilson just communicated the plan that our EVA team here on the ground came up with.,6813.6,6820.18001
Essentially astronaut Raja Chari is going to use one of the wire ties on his body restraint tether one of the tethers keeping him to the International Space Station.,6824.015,6832.06
"It was decided that these wire ties will not be used throughout the Space Station, so they're available to use on Matias Mars camera and helmet as some light assembly.",6832.2,6840.815
"He'll be attaching it to part of the SAFER unit, making sure to be careful of not interfering with the safer units' ability to safely get Matias Mauer back to the space station in the event of an emergency.",6841.675,6854.13
You're getting a live view of Mission Control in Houston.,6886.12,6889.02
Now the International Space Station Flight Control Room ware flight controllers are talking amongst themselves on a solution to the camera and helmet light assembly.,6889.16,6897.585
They've gotten instructions for NASA astronaut Tari on how to secure that into place.,6897.965,6902.4
Enter just making sure that the path is correct and agreed upon by everyone in the room.,6902.69998,6907.28
"Once this solution has been worked, where you're talking about, I've got retwisted.",7005.71,7010.61502
"All I'm trying to do is use the ret hook, put more twist into it to essentially tighten it down or When a solution has been worked, NASA astronaut Raja Chari will work to configure the robotic arm and ride it out to the radiator beam valve module while matthias Marner routes and ethernet cable.",7010.755,7029.245
"Well, I guess one caution with this batis is you probably won't be able to, like, manipulate the aiming of your lights.",7041.8,7048.405
You must have to be careful when you're up there.,7048.405,7050.32498
Yeah.,7050.32498,7050.565
That makes sense.,7050.565,7051.445
Yeah.,7051.445,7051.945
"If you could aim it, I think, if you could aim it to her right now, yeah, hold on.",7052.47,7057.05
Sorry.,7059.64502,7059.885
I'm pulling around here.,7059.885,7061.005
"And we're all done with this left center safety tethers again, so I'm hanging all over your back here trying to bond to you.",7061.005,7068.545
I see what's still out.,7089.91,7091.03
Let me try to get let me get a camera view on that so they can see it.,7091.03,7095.03
Yeah.,7095.03,7095.53
"Do you have KU back, Stephanie?",7099.655,7101.675
"Roger, we do not.",7102.535,7103.57498
And we're also about two minutes from a from a teacher's s band handover.,7103.57498,7108.69
"I have I would kinda like you to see this before I do the other side and just go I'm not wasting time, but not what you're imagining.",7111.31,7118.505
I'll fold here then until you get a view.,7121.25,7123.27
Copy that.,7123.97003,7124.6900000000005
We'll let you know.,7124.6900000000005,7125.83
Your your helmet light let's see if on that right side looks like they're in line and they probably positioned.,7126.93005,7132.66504
"But You you know, I'll have to change a little bit, but I think the right side looks good.",7133.125,7136.645
Yeah.,7136.645,7136.92
"What it could do is, like, you could flatten this, the wire tie so that it's, like, less of an obstacle when I move around.",7136.92,7145.18
"Oh, yeah.",7145.365,7145.76495
Good point.,7145.76495,7146.245
Let me try to try to get in on top of the stages.,7146.245,7149.46497
"And, Roger, let's see us also for your essay.",7151.045,7153.20496
"We're about eleven minutes, tonight.",7153.20496,7155.225
Think that body position worked pretty well.,7165.705,7167.385
So what I'm thinking is maybe I could I could just scroll through that side and I go to the forward side.,7167.385,7172.445
"For the next one, don't make sense?",7173.07996,7174.68
Yeah.,7174.68,7175.0
Okay.,7175.0,7175.5
"I I could also just your Oh, okay.",7175.72,7178.04
Yeah.,7178.04,7178.19995
Yeah.,7178.19995,7178.36
That might work.,7178.36,7179.0
Yep.,7179.0,7179.5
Trying to think.,7180.205,7181.105
But if you want me to try I don't have the handrail on this side.,7181.245,7183.645
"It doesn't go all the way around, but we try let's try.",7183.645,7185.72504
We'll try it.,7185.72504,7186.125
Looks like it's a camera view and have yaw.,7186.125,7188.045
"See if that works, that'd be the easiest thing.",7188.045,7189.87
Hold on so they can see the view.,7189.87,7191.89
Hey.,7232.280003,7232.780003
"Well, then we had great day out here.",7233.56,7235.16
I did really.,7235.16,7235.9
I did really.,7236.52,7237.24
Yeah.,7237.24,7237.64
I love my day.,7237.64,7238.36
It's covering all the great day.,7238.36,7239.9
"We're waiting for our live views of the International Space Station to come back as we hand off between satellite once we get our live view back, the folks here in Mission Control will evaluate Raja Charri's work, securing the lights and camera assembly.",7254.850002,7269.265
It looks like we're getting our live views back now.,7269.44,7271.78
Roger Matias.,7293.81,7294.71
"We're, back with you on KU.",7294.77,7296.47
Okay.,7300.354996,7300.595
"Let me get, position two.",7300.595,7302.455
Not exactly sure.,7311.4,7312.12
Would you say your MACa?,7312.12,7312.920006
That helps you see that?,7312.920006,7314.3
"Roger, nice work.",7328.27,7329.73
"We like what we see, on that side.",7330.03,7332.37
"So if you can repeat it on the other side, that'd be great.",7332.735,7335.39499
"If you're able before you swing all the way around, yep.",7345.62999,7349.79
You're actually smart.,7349.79,7350.93
I'm gonna work on getting the rep while you just wings to take your time.,7351.855,7354.655
No rush.,7354.655,7355.47499
"Just be aware you're you're With their visuals back, it looks like the ground here just confirmed with NASA astronaut Rajuachari that the camera and helmet light assembly on Matias Mauer's space suit looks good to them.",7357.61499,7369.755
We're now one hour into the spacewalk.,7370.05501,7371.99501
"Since the crew has spent considerable time working on Matias Mauer's camera and helmet light attached to his helmet there, the crew here on the ground is now discussing what procedures we'll be able to get to today.",7421.68501,7435.17
"Of course, the priority of today's tasks is the radiator beam valve module.",7435.47,7440.425
"It was not expected to take the whole spacewalk So now they're discussing what other maintenance tasks that were planned, we'll still have time for.",7440.485,7448.37999
Alright.,7467.77002,7468.01
"Once more, I'm gonna use you with the translation aid here.",7468.01,7470.59003
A little closer this time.,7471.965,7473.505
Wrapped up.,7487.23,7488.13
Wacked throughout the process.,7488.35,7489.74002
This is.,7491.505,7492.245
Alright.,7492.465,7492.965
Did you log in to your mini workstation?,7496.065,7498.005
No.,7498.38498,7498.625
You're fine.,7498.625,7499.185
Okay.,7499.185,7499.685
Okay.,7505.23,7505.73
On you again?,7514.405,7515.305
Your home.,7582.575,7583.315
And then let's we didn't round this.,7588.815,7591.75998
Thank you for Esther's Howard.,7591.75998,7593.37997
I see.,7594.47998,7595.58
Yeah.,7595.68,7595.84
I need to let you go.,7595.84,7597.13998
Yeah.,7597.19998,7597.36
"Actually, this yeah.",7597.36,7597.84
If you can hold me on this initial?,7597.84,7599.37997
That that body was good.,7599.51498,7601.865
I'm gonna move a little closer to you now.,7607.58,7609.52
Try to round it.,7610.78,7611.66
I'm just trying to get the wire tie.,7611.66,7613.36
Hit the URL gear.,7620.19498,7621.495
Hold on.,7665.17,7665.57
Let me walk out this rat.,7665.57,7666.95
"So to recap today's events, our space walkers today switched their suits to internal battery power at seven thirty two AM central time.",7670.655,7676.995
"When they exited the hatch, Matias Mar had trouble keeping his helmet camera and light firmly attached to the space suit.",7677.375,7684.22998
The spacewalk team here on the ground came up with a solution for Rajatari to use one of his wire ties on one of the tethers of his space suit to secure it into place.,7684.77,7695.05
Excellent.,7696.09,7696.59
"But even though the Matias is experiencing a problem with his space suit, the crew is in good health this has nothing to do with our astronaut.",7696.72998,7705.68503
They're both completely fine.,7705.825,7707.36502
"We just need to secure the helmet into place, as well as the light.",7707.74503,7711.685
"Oh, they had it.",7752.11,7752.67
It was flipped off.,7752.67,7753.47
So I'll put it again back to the back of the press restored.,7753.47,7756.85
Every position in here.,7762.595,7763.89496
Stay where you're at.,7767.5599999999995,7767.95996
Did you wanna let go of my Mws and stabilize yourself?,7767.95996,7770.45996
"Alright, man.",7771.0,7771.48
Yes.,7771.48,7771.72
I'll let go of my Mws and stabilize your body and watch how you use.,7771.72,7774.77997
Yeah.,7775.50494,7776.00494
I think this is work better.,7802.72,7804.26
And there's three twists.,7827.315,7828.435
I'm a start tightening it with a rut.,7828.435,7830.295
Okay.,7878.055,7878.215
Thanks.,7878.215,7878.534996
There we are.,7878.534996,7879.435
Okay.,7913.725,7913.885
He's moved.,7914.205,7914.765
He's the routing for that one.,7914.765,7916.205
I know if you're happy with that.,7916.205,7917.665
Alright.,7918.49,7918.99
"Roger, nice work.",7924.409996,7925.45
We are happy with that routing.,7925.45,7927.149994
"And big picture, now that we have completed that work, we're going to reset as you hit think of it.",7928.615,7937.83
I'll get a glove and half check from you.,7938.47,7940.57
We'll start the initial test tasks for this EVA as we have planned and as are written.,7940.87,7946.57
And we'll assess as we go the task at the end.,7946.645,7950.10501
"I, heard your reference earlier to gray tape.",7950.565,7952.88501
I like that.,7952.88501,7953.685
That does fix all as does teamwork You guys did a nice job working together and working through this.,7953.685,7958.96
"And, we're here with you, and, we will get the get the task accomplished for this EVA.",7958.96,7964.64
Nice work.,7964.64,7965.46
Okay.,7966.785,7967.265
"Thanks, killer.",7967.265,7967.905
Thank you.,7967.905,7968.725
"Let's clean up our tethers and stuff because I know we crossed a few times there, but he is trying to turn it on on the better.",7968.865,7975.105
So Take your time and then we'll take thirty checks once we are happy with urgency.,7975.105,7979.03
"And we're now able to see the helmet camera views of both of our space walking astronauts today, Rajatari on the left, who's our EV one, and Matias Mara on the right as EV two.",7982.20999,7992.255
Okay.,8005.385,8005.86499
I verified my anchor hook.,8005.86499,8008.045
It's on black feel unblocked.,8008.665,8015.39
What?,8017.12999,8017.62999
I don't know who is attached to the green rail.,8017.97,8021.39
"Box, control, black on black, and the anchor will come on by two just also, control, black on black.",8021.685,8028.74
Live.,8028.98001,8029.48001
Now that Matias Mauer has his camera and helmet light fully secured and is not interfering with his SAFER unit in any way.,8029.94,8037.195
They're gonna go on as if they just got out the door.,8037.755,8040.49501
"We are about a minute, an hour and twelve minutes into our spacewalk here today.",8040.875,8044.975
Just beginning our tasks now.,8045.23001,8047.17
They're gonna do buddy checks right now and Tethr checks now.,8047.71,8050.53
I can see your bundle on the left side.,8051.43,8055.435
Looks pretty secure and back out of your way.,8055.435,8057.695
"After their buddy checks conclude, they'll make their way to their first work site.",8058.315,8062.335
"Flat boots, you'll be good on tethers in terms of mind.",8063.34,8065.91998
I see my anchor hook marked EV one single on the f c.,8066.06,8069.91998
I prefer fifty nine.,8070.435,8071.795
That is locked.,8071.795,8073.015

"It is gate closed black, black, and it's the red and white weather code number one.",8086.05,8091.525
And my right fixed other pack is attached with me.,8093.98502,8097.77002
We're stationed on the right gear extended.,8097.77002,8099.13
That's the drop them later.,8099.13,8100.35
"And if you can check my local a bit when I was crawling on you, I think.",8100.56998,8106.685
Yeah.,8106.685,8107.00497
We try to reconfigure that before we start traveling.,8107.00497,8109.185
With one large of the door open.,8113.6,8115.38
Good to shoot.,8115.68002,8116.5
You're getting a good view now of NASA Ashnot Rajatari.,8118.56,8121.14
You can tell because he's red stripes on his legs.,8121.28,8123.925
"In just a moment, you should be able to see two bright light shining out from his helmet.",8124.385,8128.245
"Those are the those are the light that we're we were fixing on the camera of Matias Mowers helmet, who's you're looking at his point of view now.",8128.305,8135.97998
Alright.,8137.79498,8138.275
So let me have a buddy check on you.,8138.275,8140.29498
"I see take a light on sub g v s side as well and I see, like, four cameras four lights on.",8140.35498,8147.38
"The side light, the mini workstation stack on two three was to be a key one.",8148.1,8156.52502
Our lap.,8156.52502,8157.265
It's good.,8157.565,8158.045
"Braaper handle, close down.",8158.045,8160.52502
"If you hold it just in my face, it goes down.",8160.52502,8163.905
And the safety center configuration you reported.,8165.33,8167.83
So you look in the good shape for me.,8167.88998,8170.21

"If you go important, wait for your tether to pull a little tautier, then I'll send him that.",8276.525,8280.14502
"The first stop for our space walkers is the crew equipment an aid cart or a cetah cart, where Matias Mar is going to be headed.",8289.36002,8298.02502
The cetah cart is an aid to the space walkers and a spot where the spacewalkers can attach equipment when they need to stow something.,8298.325,8305.16
"Mar will stow his tool bag to the seat of cart while Rajatari follows the same path shortly after, and retrieves a portable foot restraint from the same CETA cart.",8306.42,8314.775
This portable foot restraint attaches to the station's robotic arm so the arm can move Charlie to various work sites today.,8315.235,8321.255
I've got a feeder card.,8324.33,8325.79

Fortunate so that radiator had to be turned off because the hoses were removed in a spacewalk in twenty eighteen.,10218.96,10226.98
So that all went well and the hose was brought back to the ground and refurbished and sent back up.,10227.955,10233.155
"But in the meantime, the radiator had to be turned off.",10233.155,10235.655

I still love the caution.,12439.12,12440.74
If you're just joining us for about two and a half hours into our space walk today with NASA astronaut Rajachari and European space agency astronaut Matias Mar.,12445.03497,12454.07
"They began the first hour of their space walk together at the airlock where they troubleshooting some issues with Matias Mars, helmet camera and the light that attaches to his helmet.",12454.53,12464.525
"Once they got figured out, they split up.",12464.905,12467.06
And they're now working at opposite ends of the truss.,12467.06,12469.32
"Raj Jocari has connected the first side of the two hoses to the radiator beam valve module, and his move is currently moving over to the radiator side where he can connect the other two the other side of the hoses.",12470.1,12482.995

What I'm thinking is we'll do some body in and then maybe do some body roll.,12751.06999,12754.53
"It could be away from the pinch bolt, but let's just try to straight body in for now and see how that works out.",12754.735,12760.595
I should have I've got a whole arc of the cinch valve right now.,12760.655,12765.06999

Very small.,13185.27997,13186.08
Nothing.,13186.08,13186.58
That drove came loose right under the fence.,13187.2,13189.46

And we copy the words.,13203.6799998,13205.14
Thanks for the report.,13205.44,13206.74
"One minute, twenty seconds from a handover, but I'll get the caution in and then we'll pick up the mate on the other side.",13208.535,13214.81
"After opening a valve, limit torx at the QD interface to prevent twisting and open QD valve.",13215.05,13220.19

"He took off some caps Since there weren't hoses there previously, there were caps in their place.",13272.97,13277.375
So he took them off.,13277.375,13278.575005
"He connected two jumpers to the radiator via valve module side, and we'll connect the jumpers to the radiator side and open the valve since he's already on that side.",13278.575005,13288.3
Then he's gonna go back to the radiator beam valve module side and open the valve there.,13288.44,13293.005
"Even though the valves on both sides of the hoses are connected and the hoses themselves are connected, No liquid will be fro flowing through even though both of the valves are open.",13293.705,13302.990005
He'll also install two electrical connectors that provide heater power.,13303.37,13307.47
Is there anything else you need to talk to about before I go These electrical connectors give mission control the ability to control the internal valves in addition to heater power.,13313.825005,13323.75
These internal valves will be used by mission control who can command the RBVM to open its internal valves and reactivate that part of the radiator and send ammonia through.,13324.13,13335.735
Is gonna be this is gonna be a little more difficult.,13336.42,13339.38
I think you'll be on the side.,13339.38,13341.16

Mara will move on to the platform.,13439.14,13440.82
It's hit the platform itself to close some cable plants on the zenith or space facing side.,13440.82,13446.325
This task allows for future installation of payloads by the robotic arm.,13446.465,13450.325
"Even though Mar is on the Columbus module now, he does have a bag stowed onto the US Destiny module.",13458.445,13464.225
"And so when he's done with this task, he'll return to his tool bag and move on to some other tasks.",13464.365,13468.45

The valves that Chari is working to open will allow the capability for mission control here on the ground to run ammonia through these hoses that he just hooked up.,14965.63,14976.005
No hoses no ammonia is gonna flow through now.,14976.385,14979.14
But they're gonna test it out at the end of the sometime after the EVA.,14979.22003,14982.68
"When the ammonia flows to the radiator, the radiator will be back online.",14983.46,14987.08
Able to provide cooling for the International Space Station and its onboard systems.,14987.935,14993.235

Our spacewalk began just about three and a half hours ago with Raja Chari first out the gate of the Quest airlock followed by his counterpart Matias Mauer.,16393.835,16403.64
They spent about an hour at the airlock working a problem with the camera and onboard light that was attached to Matias Mars.,16404.26,16415.035
Space suit had a little trouble staying on but Rajatari was able to troubleshoot with the ground and get that secure.,16415.255,16420.87001
And then they were on their way for their other tasks.,16420.93001,16423.19
While Rajatari was setting up the robotic arm that he's on now and will be spending through the rest of the spacewalk.,16423.65001,16429.935
Matias Mauer got started on other tasks.,16430.47499,16432.575
"He routed an ethernet cable, attached them to some handrails.",16433.18001,16437.2
This is gonna be used later on a camera that they'll be working on in just a few minutes.,16437.26001,16441.815
"He also installed a jumper onto the Columbus module and then moved over into and released some clamps on the Barta Lomeo Science platform, allowing for the future installation by our robotic arm after the EVA.",16442.275,16455.34

The RBVM jumper installation.,16463.57,16465.43
"He got the hoses installed and the valves open, and now he's just working to install some heater power.",16466.13,16471.99002

This is an HD camera that sits on the outside of the International Space Station.,16500.96,16505.53998
It is has a wireless access point that they'll be working around and working to install.,16505.725,16510.785
"This is a series of cameras that is being installed, the last two being installed January of twenty twenty one by Spacewalkers Mike Hopkins and Victor glover.",16511.885,16520.38998
"And, Roger, for seven eighty two, does it appear that the cable is too tight with releasing it from the clear TA clamp, give you some additional room to work?",16563.47,16572.865
I think so.,16575.325,16576.045
"It actually seems like I'm sure it's something I'm doing wrong, but, like, the tolerance So I'm looking at the connector.",16576.045,16583.49

Let's just lining on the as I'm looking at this three o'clock size.,16597.285,16602.46
"Maybe I can try to see a couple of seconds, but I don't think that's what's causing.",16606.335,16609.39502

"You can see, like, I don't know if you can see my camera view, but on this side, which is the aft side.",16646.475,16651.56998
"So it's aligned on the lower side, touching.",16652.75,16657.09
"On the right side, it will shuttle into the I don't see any galling or damage on the Roger, we do see it in your helmet camera.",16658.245,16682.805
"Unfortunately, seven eighty three is, for us, a bit blocking the view of seven eighty two.",16682.805,16688.39
Right.,16715.97003,16716.21
Now you're getting a live view of Matias Mar as he works to secure that insulation with wire ties.,16716.21,16721.91003
"Basically, this is just a thermal blanket that works to protect the onboard electronics and wires that may be exposed to the vacuum of space.",16721.97003,16729.625

Couldn't go from the other side first.,16753.17,16754.79

It goes under that side corner of NOI.,16769.41504,16771.435
"But the seven eight three routing, the only way to cover that with MLI would be to pick up that flap, which I think it said not to pick up.",16771.81,16780.14996
In the breathing package.,16780.345,16781.945

Okay.,19669.41498,19669.815
"And the other one, just a pop up too.",19669.815,19671.655
I think it's the name of that one is gated.,19671.655,19673.755
The light jumper is Good pen.,19674.375,19677.19
So far.,19677.19,19677.66998

Say that again.,19710.34,19711.24
Copy.,19712.74,19713.24
Now you can lift the cam lever ninety degrees and remove the HD camera by sliding towards the connectors.,19713.38,19718.92
"The old camera is now completely disconnected from the space station, and now Raja Chari is working to remove it.",19722.525,19728.54504
Can't remember so much.,19741.63495,19742.935
Alright.,19744.18,19744.68
So this cold panel is off.,19749.62,19751.48
Copy.,19751.795,19752.195
You can temp stow that on the outside of the ORU bag and retrieve the WAP HD camera from the bag to install onto the SD camera.,19752.195,19761.575
"And there it is, the old camera facing the earth from the International Space Station.",19763.78,19768.44
"Now, disconnect it and in the arms of astronaut Rajatari as he places it back into a bag to temporarily stow it out of the way so that he can focus on installing the new camera.",19769.375,19779.93
"Hey, AT, on the external bags going to the cutting point of the cameras.",19801.92,19805.6
I'm taking my reps off the lip.,19805.6,19808.5
Bag.,19810.405,19810.905
You see the brown window cover coming into view on the camera.,19915.935005,19919.475
"Raja Chari just installed that prior to unhooking all of the cables that connected the camera to the space station, and he's now working to put it safely away in a bag.",19919.775,19931.19
"He'll be working in reverse when installing the new camera, first removing the window cover, and then mating the wireless access port and a light jumper cable.",19951.05501,19962.44
You're trying to find a lot of arch.,19966.065,19967.58499
"The cam lever is in the locked position, but kind of thousands around in zero g.",19967.58499,19973.75
"Alright, Mark.",19974.63,19975.11
I don't think it actually go all the way on.,19975.11,19977.29
Copy.,19985.565,19985.965
The cam lever is locked.,19985.965,19987.165
And did you happen to see it pop out and then pop back in as you were sliding it on?,19987.165,19992.305
It's not on all the way.,19994.43,19995.55
I can tell I can see the eleven mark now.,19995.55,19997.56999
Copy.,19997.87,19998.37
"Well, it's still got a ways to go.",19999.79,20001.56999
It's kinda stuck.,20002.36499,20003.425
Pleasure to talk.,20003.485,20009.905
"Again, just it is not flush on the top side.",20011.06,20013.62
I could see it's not fully in.,20013.62,20015.15999
"It does seem like it's aligned, like, it's up down.",20017.06,20019.54
It's back where it's at.,20019.54,20022.24501
Wanna move up anymore.,20023.66501,20024.80501
Just flick it and then push from the top.,20029.28,20031.45999
I'm gonna back it down a little bit.,20050.63,20052.07
See if I can think on my side there is from the MLI on the box that you slide lower as a small forward.,20052.07,20062.77
That that keeps the flighty survey.,20063.25,20066.55
"This camera installation is the second major task of the space walk today for NASA astronaut Rajatari and European Space Agency astronaut, Matias Mar.",20070.975,20079.38
The first major task of the day and the priority of today's EVA was to install hoses to the radiator beam valve module.,20079.78,20087.0
To one of the radiators on the space station.,20087.555,20090.055
Rajatari aboard the robotic arm was able to mate both sides of the hoses between the radiator beam valve module and the radiator itself.,20090.51498,20099.36
Open some valves so that ammonia can flow through at the command of the mission control here in the ground.,20099.66,20105.825
At a later date.,20106.14502,20107.20502
Any also installed heater cables that the ground verified were installed correctly and were working properly.,20107.42502,20113.36502
Now they're moving on to the camera installation.,20113.825,20116.87
"The old camera worked fine, but this new one provides improved to a high data rate communication between external payloads and earth.",20117.88998,20126.13498
Okay.,20126.675,20126.835
No.,20126.835,20127.07498
I hired.,20127.07498,20127.555
"To me, it just feels like it's not far in the mood.",20127.555,20129.395
No.,20129.395,20129.555
"I I don't think it's on my side that that actually, like, how did you wiggle it?",20129.555,20133.815
Pretty clear if that's the idea.,20134.18,20135.54
Yeah.,20135.54,20136.04
Yeah.,20136.94,20137.44
"I pulled it out completely again, and then my father made progress there.",20138.34,20142.305
I can't tell.,20142.305,20143.125
Yeah.,20143.26498,20143.76498
I think it's close actually.,20143.82498,20145.10498
Go.,20145.10498,20145.505
It could draw up a little bit.,20145.505,20146.965
Good.,20147.425,20147.925
I don't like it moved.,20147.985,20149.125
"Like, there's so much friction stuff that I can't tell if that cam block is moving or not because it's And, Roger, we copy.",20150.41,20164.235
"We're, looking at the crib sheets.",20164.235,20166.335
Understand you.,20169.84,20170.97998
The alignment mark is hard to gauge and difficult to align.,20171.59998,20177.21997
Are you able to push the cam lever to verify it's locked?,20177.425,20180.645
"It it is in the locked position, but it's been in the locked position the whole time.",20186.83,20190.21
"And, separately, from my position, I can see that the the way out of most out of work, kind of with the cooling side, that is kind of and, like, proceeding from top of the other box.",20190.75,20205.36002
"So I would say, like, kind of three four centimeters.",20205.36002,20207.62003
That's the expected.,20208.88,20209.78
Trying to convince myself there's a lot of hard to flush on the the right.,20212.215,20217.275
To make sure I get it in my mirror.,20218.91,20220.77002
"So I definitely moved from what I was at before, but based on how much force I was having to use bare metal.",20221.71,20227.57
"I definitely couldn't observe the camera, but we'll pop up and down.",20228.155,20232.335
Copy.,20233.835,20234.235
"And Matias, are you saying Are you saying that the camera is not parallel from your vantage point?",20234.235,20239.81998
From my view cameras now installed the end of it.,20241.96,20245.98502
"So the most, either for sports is not flush with the box that's on that it is installed to.",20246.205,20254.35
"There's still three centimeters of, of, yeah, height difference.",20254.65002,20259.23
Right.,20259.765,20260.005
"So, yeah, because they're changing only loud.",20260.005,20261.605
There's a black web and black on my side.,20261.605,20263.465
Copy.,20265.045,20265.545
"One idea as I could GCA the other side to the PA clamp side, then I could deal with that see those align the marks straight on.",20270.66,20279.76498
"You know, pull back here too.",20283.585,20284.785
"I mean, just stop it's not moving either direction.",20284.785,20287.66998
Just trying to pull down on it.,20289.25,20290.61
"And we understand, Roger, move the cam lever to the unlock position and try to partially remove the camera approximately a quarter inch.",20290.61,20299.30502
Push the cam lever into the lock position and then attempt to move it towards install.,20299.765,20305.30502
"So unlock, move it to quarter inch in the back down.",20308.7,20311.6
Right?,20312.62,20313.12
Correct.,20313.42,20313.92
They're the quarter inch.,20314.995,20316.215

I think I just yep.,20319.395,20320.35504
They just popped.,20320.35504,20321.335
What should be installed?,20326.97003,20328.09
Let's check.,20328.09,20328.91003
Yes.,20335.995,20336.31494

"So I'm looking through a mirror, notice I can't see this.",20337.83496,20342.43
"There's a there's a ton of screws around the VA clamp side of the new camera and the So the black alignment mark lines up with the the the second true on the bottom, and that second true is aligned with the SD camera.",20342.73004,20365.895
"So I'm pretty confident that those are lines, but if on the ground, if that black line the lobby mark on the HD camera and that second crew are actually parallel to each other.",20365.895,20376.91
"They they look in the mirrors, and maybe if not.",20376.91,20378.51
"But, first, I can tell the mirror, they are aligned.",20378.51,20383.11505
And I did see the camera to pop that time.,20383.73505,20385.995
Copy.,20389.79,20389.94995
On on it.,20390.02997,20390.43

Short wire tie and the WAP cable to the PTU cable and light jumper.,20781.555,20785.175
So I'm putting those two fifty eight clamps first and then the wire tie.,20788.97998,20792.12
"Here it has the wire tie and then the routing to the TA clamp, but whatever, works whatever you think will work best.",20795.995,20802.655
I think we might try to we try to get into the office with less stuff fluid around you.,20804.29,20808.55
Copy.,20809.09,20809.59
For some background on what you're seeing here.,20859.79498,20862.135
"Space bonkers have installed multiple wireless access port capable HD cameras in various locations around the outside of the International Space Station, the last two, occurred being installed in early two thousand and one, But this is gonna be the first time that a camera has been completely taken off and replaced with a new unit rather than just in stalling the new unit, at an area where they're able to connect it.",20862.755,20891.78

That's the way to go to the you keep she came in with you and back in our position.,20913.295,20916.655
That's correct.,20916.655,20917.215
You can work with Kayla and Tom.,20917.215,20919.155
Okay.,20920.98,20921.22
"And that's is a go, I think.",20921.22,20922.74
Is that the correct metal GCA?,20922.74,20924.27997
Or do you need to back me out of where I'm at?,20924.66,20926.68
"We copy, Roger.",20927.755,20929.055

"Therefore, we're gonna start motion, the body out one meter, and we'll incorporate body up forty five.",20938.06,20943.2
Starting motion buddy up.,20946.115,20947.65497
Camera installation can be a tricky job for the spacewalkers due to just the nature of the stanchions that they're mounted to with the addition of the wireless access port capability The crew also has to keep in mind the intricate installation of clamps and straps to make sure that the hard line ethernet connection to the back of the camera doesn't get tangled when the camera pans or tilts.,20955.49,20986.28503
For whatever operation it may be supporting at the time.,20987.28,20989.94
I see the body.,20996.135,20996.85504
Yeah.,20996.85504,20997.35504

Okay.,21033.95,21034.45
I'm turning over to Twitter now to take one of the ask NASA questions that will be received from Elaine who's asking when the new camera will be operational.,21064.89,21072.67
"To answer her question, the new camera will be operational as soon as we the ethernet cable on the back end of the HD camera and made it to the ethernet cable that Matias Mauer had routed as his first task of the space walk.",21077.295,21089.79
"Roger, we're starting a one minute forecast.",21091.195,21093.115

There's Stephanie anything before we set up the GCA?,21308.99503,21311.015
Nope.,21311.55502,21312.05502
The same bike of webs with a unique tenant.,21312.41998,21314.84
Okay.,21315.3,21315.69998
That'd be right.,21315.69998,21316.34
That's for the cable.,21316.34,21317.47998
And you're any time I'm ready for the GCA to publish cable restraint access position.,21317.62,21322.725

You can probably see it actually in the camera view.,21355.76498,21359.705
But there's top of the black line is most definitely flush with the bottom of the SD camera.,21361.525,21369.36002
"Roger, we're ready for your GCA to publish.",21372.395,21374.555

And clear.,21378.31998,21380.41998
Alright.,21380.87997,21381.19998
Let's start GCA.,21381.19998,21382.25998
On the GCA starting motion.,21384.08,21385.75998
I've got the clearance which came by helmet.,21385.75998,21387.585
For the year.,21388.145,21388.965
"Raja Chari, now doing a quick evaluation of the cables that he's been plugging in to get this camera online confirming with the ground that he installed it properly, and they confirmed that all looks good.",21389.345,21400.50998
You don't need to go I think I was slowing down.,21412.715,21422.81

Let us know if you need additional GCA?,21431.11502,21432.71503
"I think this is gonna work just fine, but Call GCA complete.",21432.71503,21436.05
Hey GCA complete.,21436.35,21437.15
You're go to work.,21437.15,21438.03
"Roger, route the WAP cable through the PTU cable restraint.",21438.03,21443.25
Okay.,21445.455,21445.955
"Rajya Chari now working to route the wireless access port, cable, basically doing some cable management here so that the wires are nice and tucked out of the way.",21459.05,21468.725
Got it for the TCU cable restraints?,21526.325,21527.945
We've now reached the five hour mark of our spacewalk with astronaut Raja Charri on screen now.,21540.70496,21547.105
"You're looking from his point of view, as he works to install a new high definition camera to the outside of the international space station.",21547.105,21554.31

I'll just have them send it to you there.,21563.885,21565.71
You were just looking at the camera from his point of view.,21566.51,21568.91003
Now we're getting a wider view of Rajatari with the red stripe on his space suit at the end of the robotic arm doing some work.,21568.91003,21577.235
Matias Mowers in the space suit without any marks on it at the top of your screen.,21577.375,21581.95496
Does it matter?,21584.48,21585.04
I don't know if you can can you see my heck of view?,21585.04,21587.12
Does the black cable or the battery if it goes?,21587.12,21589.86
Above or below the light jumper cable.,21590.945,21594.005
Checking.,21596.22504,21596.72504
I don't think we think a difference.,21609.035,21610.575
"It's only, like, more grip difference than routing.",21611.514999,21613.934999
"In the meantime, I'll have you grab on to the stand if you can do that.",21617.23,21620.21
Yeah.,21632.97,21633.21
So you're starting with your Okay.,21633.21,21634.92
Sure.,21659.335,21659.495
It's fine.,21659.495,21659.895
"The way it is, because it's the the back with wire ties, the outside of that CA cliff running.",21659.895,21664.235
"I think it's gotta be like that, but but for it doesn't matter.",21664.695,21668.54
"And, Roger, we copy.",21673.0,21674.200005
"We were, looking at the imagery and the loop It should be more aligned with the light cable, and so you can open the, lock a lever on the restraint, and in a sense, flip the cable over so that the the marshmallow's reverse but and then reinstall it into the clamp.",21674.200005,21693.534996
And then the loop will be from your in your view at the bottom.,21693.534996,21696.755
"Oh, I see.",21699.54,21700.1
Gotcha.,21700.1,21700.340004
Okay.,21700.340004,21700.58
Yep.,21700.58,21700.9
That's my bad.,21700.9,21701.96
Rajatari working at the ground now at the exact route he should be taking the wireless access port cable.,21704.9,21710.314995
There's very specific instructions from the ground on exactly how they want this fire to be placed to be out of the way so that the camera has the ability to move all around.,21712.935,21721.770004
Travis?,21746.885,21747.385
Yeah.,21747.525,21747.605

Okay.,21748.885,21749.20499
Okay.,21749.20499,21749.70499
Just out of the way.,21750.77,21751.91
I see on the WVS.,21782.66501,21783.725
"With both cables in there, it's hard to get that.",21784.585,21787.005
Clamp depressed enough to pull the lock in that route.,21788.33,21790.65001
I'm trying to find it.,21790.65001,21791.85
Is this where I can do that?,21791.85,21793.47
And we copy.,21797.345,21798.145
We we see that as well.,21798.145,21799.505
Right?,21799.505,21799.745
The cables are filling up the putting some some back pressure on that lever.,21799.745,21804.965
Our only words are to continue doing what you're doing.,21806.55,21808.71
Just a couple seconds.,21808.71,21809.85
"Push in and, rotate the lock lever towards the light.",21810.47,21813.625
Here we go.,21826.69,21827.59
You're getting a live look at Mission Control in Houston.,21861.905,21864.625
"Now the International Space Station Flight Control Room during a brief handover period to recap what Rajaachari has done, on the second task that he's working on.",21864.625,21874.12
He's replacing on HD camera on the outside of the International Space Station.,21874.12,21878.695
He was able to unhook the old camera and remove it from stanchion without any problems.,21878.915,21884.94
The old camera is now stowed on his person.,21885.96,21888.86
He has successfully put the new camera on to the stanchion and is working to get it routed properly with the right cables and in the right positions.,21889.56,21898.055
Do you have your handover?,21898.055,21899.115
We like the plan.,21899.255,21900.315
"Copy, RASA.",21904.34,21905.13998
We're gonna be gluing you body out fifty five centimeters.,21905.13998,21908.43997
Standby commotion.,21908.9,21909.87997
"Starting motion now, buddy.",21912.865,21914.16498
Yep.,21914.38498,21914.865
"While I'm doing this, I just wanna get your confirmation that this looks like a good install for this camera since I'm not gonna see this weather mark.",21914.865,21921.35
Houston.,21924.63,21924.79
"Once we come back, the ground crew is going to take a look at Raja Chari's work, make sure that all the cables are exactly where they would like it to be.",21924.79,21931.705
It incurs a good install.,21931.705,21933.085
And we've confirmed good installation.,21933.785,21935.405
His next task is gonna be looking for the ethernet cable that Matias Mar had routed as one of his first tasks of the spacewalk.,21936.24,21943.78
These guys in the line of arch.,21944.495,21945.615
"Like I said, it's the the very top part of the black line is touching the back, SD camera line.",21945.615,21952.035
It's not.,21952.735,21953.395
Yeah.,21954.72,21954.88
"I know the surface that you extended on the black, but it's touch touching black enough, basically, to the bottom of the black, and that makes sense.",21954.88,21961.06
"And we understand and with all the checks that you performed, we're happy.",21961.57498,21965.035
"Azure, we're setting up for one of three Joe Casas.",21970.52,21972.76

Your intuition was correct.,21988.68,21990.44
"It didn't quite match, what we had seen before.",21990.44,21994.06
So good talking about it also.,21994.19998,21996.22
"And, Stephanie, is there anything that I could do on my end here with the cable, the cable cap?",22002.105,22006.445

Rajatari now approaching the back of the camera on the end of the robotic arm.,22209.195001,22214.095
This task will bring the camera online.,22214.395,22216.735
The new camera is operational as soon as the ethernet cable on the back is mated with the that of the ethernet cable that Matias Mauer had routed earlier.,22217.15,22227.305

It'll be about seventy five centimeters away from the camera at the end.,22372.6,22375.66
I see good pins.,22382.245,22383.22499
No fuss with the broadband.,22383.36499,22384.825

Wrapping out.,22926.565,22927.625
I'm just evaluating here.,22934.17,22935.465
To see the butt.,22936.905,22937.965
Yeah.,22939.14499,22939.385
I think this is gonna work actually where we're at without going without getting the rest of it.,22939.385,22943.965
It's a check's deputy or am I way off?,22944.69,22947.11
Sorry.,22949.01,22949.33
It looks that's it.,22949.33,22950.63
What was what was left?,22950.85,22951.73
"Just more body up, or was there any other Russian back.",22951.73,22954.905
Ten meters body up still left.,22955.205,22956.885

I'm gonna have the Glad here to go to work.,22965.42,22968.94
Copy.,22968.94,22969.44
"And, Raj, if you feel you can access the tether point on the front to install the front part of the WAP rock with the court with the quarter turn faster, then that's a good position.",22969.895,22980.19
Yeah.,22982.01001,22982.25
Yeah.,22982.25,22982.41
That's what I was looking at.,22982.41,22983.45
"I think if I kept going, I would have gone too high to reach it.",22983.45,22986.35
So place the quarter turn fastener side on the electronics box tether point with the Velcro towards the stanchion base.,22987.875,22994.055
Mating Velcro should be facing outward.,23012.84,23015.09999
"And the quarter turned faster, I should be facing me or closer to me or away from me.",23020.075,23024.33499
Away from you.,23027.25,23028.39
And you'll place your Good call.,23034.94499,23040.405
Make sure there's this switched to this first.,23041.50499,23045.29
Take over.,23046.15,23046.62999
Would you have a second?,23046.62999,23047.84999
I'll twist it over here.,23048.62999,23050.09
"And, Roger, one change, before you continue.",23058.595,23061.655
"The, Velcro should be on the nadir side.",23062.99002,23067.97
"Trying now working with the ground on how to manage the cables between the camera, the stanchion, and a strap that he's installing with wire ties and Velcro, basically keeping the cables out of the way.",23070.89502,23084.57
So that the camera has free range of motion.,23084.76498,23087.185
What was that cable twisted?,23092.75,23094.05
Okay.,23106.015,23106.335
Is that the data side on the short term password towards me?,23106.335,23109.775
"So, Roger, the cable, needs to route around the other side of the camera.",23109.775,23115.22
"If that makes sense, that should come from two towards your left hand and then feed around.",23115.52,23119.255
So that's the confusion.,23119.415,23120.475
Okay.,23121.095,23121.595
Matias Mauer now assisting Rajatari as he brings the wire around to the other side of the camera and handing it back to Chari.,23125.415,23133.82
Mauer is assisting in this operation.,23134.28,23136.38
As Chari gets his wires configured exactly where they need to go.,23136.72498,23140.32498
There's a very specific path that these wires need to take to stay out of the way.,23140.32498,23144.585
And that's affirm.,23150.13998,23151.04
Okay.,23153.29498,23153.535
And this wasn't expected.,23153.535,23154.755
Sorry about that.,23155.375,23156.175
I wasn't expecting it to be not bad news.,23156.175,23160.51498
"I know there's no upside down in space, but it's kind of upside down.",23168.44,23171.74
Yeah.,23177.67502,23177.835
"According to our traffic, the towards me.",23177.835,23179.515
Now it makes a lot more sense.,23179.515,23181.375
"Soccer was out and nadir, and then this end is going around just the long wire side of the TSM on the I'm twisted here for associates before I hand it off to you.",23181.78,23193.225
You see if there's twisting on your side at all?,23214.6,23217.02002
Give it so fast.,23223.16498,23224.225
Okay.,23224.44498,23224.845
Now you can put it.,23224.845,23225.985
That thin rust color thing you see flying into view is a wire tie.,23234.54,23240.08002
"Wire ties are one of the many tools in a space walkers arsenal, and they're used to keep cables tidying out of the way.",23240.245,23246.185
To be clear.,23250.08002,23250.90002
Go ahead.,23254.56003,23255.14
K.,23255.28,23255.52002
It looks like okay.,23255.52002,23256.66
Alright.,23257.295,23257.61502
There's no switch on my side.,23257.61502,23258.89502
I see the alligator.,23258.89502,23259.875
Put those on the outside straps.,23260.975,23262.915
"The black cable is outside the strap, so that looks good.",23263.135,23265.475
And how are you doing today?,23266.03998,23267.4
Got it for a second?,23267.4,23268.36
Yeah.,23268.36,23268.75998
Alright.,23268.75998,23269.25998
Charry is working with a checklist now.,23283.66998,23285.93
A couple of ways to verify that what he's doing is correct.,23286.06998,23289.21
He'll be placing a fastener making sure that the Velcro is facing the stanchion.,23289.75,23294.605
He'll be using his wire ties to route the strap around the section that he's working on and to pull it tight.,23294.825,23300.605
He'll verify that the strap is flat and verify that there's no slack on the strap that he's installing now.,23301.49,23308.06998
We're now five hours and thirty minutes of space walking time.,23318.35004,23323.01
"Well, I tightened your side.",23324.59,23326.13
"Should go around the circle part of the bottom and then the square on the top, which which one it is.",23327.035,23331.375
K?,23333.115,23333.615
Good words.,23333.915,23334.475
I'm gonna put the wire tie through it.,23334.475,23336.33496
"It sounds like you checked that the strap is flat, and I heard a call about the French hook on the exterior.",23339.02,23343.60004
"The truck is on the exterior, and the black cable is outside the black strap.",23346.635,23352.975
"Roman, through it now.",23353.835,23355.135
"Wireshine through the tether point, and then just pushed up the profile against the Velcro, is there a better place to put to get that excess wire, seventy, or are you guys happy with that, Rick?",23383.135,23394.67004
Why you're not stepping else if you want?,23395.13,23396.91003
"And, Roger, that's a that's good.",23401.52,23403.54
"We like the, config of the strap and the wire tie Ready?",23404.0,23409.495
Alright.,23409.495,23409.8949995
"So then for the rest of this cable, do you need to put those through the gate caps or the the spread down?",23409.8949995,23416.395
Take the slack out that you want.,23418.12,23419.48
Now it's here.,23419.48,23420.38
And the slack that's in the cable?,23429.724998,23431.345
Is is good because we need that for the pan and tilt ability.,23432.11,23435.809998
Okay.,23437.949997,23438.449997
And the ground just confirmed with our space walkers that that's a good installation of the wireless access port capable HD camera on the outside of the International Space Station.,23444.255,23453.48
"And, Roger, we need you to verify the SD Camera lens hood is square to the camera.",23454.74,23459.24
Alright.,23461.885,23462.204998
Can I get the SD What camera?,23462.204998,23464.065
"The camera lens hood is a square to the camera, so that's all in line and flush.",23464.205,23469.665
"And we we can see this in the video, and we show it in a good config.",23479.995,23483.935
Okay.,23485.81,23486.049995
Alright.,23486.049995,23486.369995

"Otherwise, he has a small conflict with my translation type.",23565.095,23568.795
"And Raja Chari is in motion on the robotic arm, once again, having completed the installation of the camera.",23569.31999,23575.02

"Meanwhile, with Raja Chari on the move, Matias Mara will make his way to his next worksite as well.",23590.85,23596.79001

As our spacewalkers are wrapping up their final tasks and heading for a cleanup.,24066.89,24071.39
The primary task for the spacewalk was to replace two hoses on one of the space stations radiator beam valve modules or r VBMs.,24071.93,24079.765
"An r VBM has two hoses or fluid jumpers that run out to one of the stations radiators, which is part of the cooling system of the space station.",24080.545,24089.19

"Each RBVM contains sensors that monitor pressure, temperature, and the position of the valve.",24101.954994,24107.07
"In other words, there's a box on the space station that can be controlled by controllers in mission control, and they're able to control the ammonia flowing through the radiators to cool down the orbiting lab.",24107.61,24117.475
"These hoses were found to have been leaking several years ago, removed during a previous spacewalk in twenty eighteen, fixed back on earth, and flown to the space station once again.",24119.03,24129.115
"When the hoses were removed, that particular radiator beam valve module had to be shut down.",24130.05501,24135.27501
"Fortunately, the station has six radiators with twelve total RVBM, so losing functionality on one did not significantly impact the station's ability to get rid of excess heat.",24135.68001,24145.415

Let me know if you would like a change to the rate.,27768.515,27771.655
K.,27771.715,27772.215
It's kinda in the beginning.,27772.99,27774.27
It was pretty slowly for three.,27774.27,27776.29001
Alright.,27780.155,27780.635
About a slow rate.,27780.635,27781.515
You let me know if it's good or you'd like an increase?,27781.515,27783.935
Thank you.,27785.11499,27785.935
Kayla Baron just let our space walking astronauts know that repressurization will begin soon at their comfort level.,27790.95999,27798.165
"And indeed, repressurization has started and the pressure of the crew lock is steadily increasing.",27817.755,27822.42
Good with this rate.,27824.4,27825.12
"If you wanna think about it a little bit, I'll give you a few seconds.",27825.12,27827.7
"For that, I'm preferring a little bit.",27831.115,27832.955

Charlie and Mara reported that they are comfortable with the rate.,27850.755,27854.455
"That the crew lock is pressurizing, and in fact that they could have it go a little bit faster.",27854.68001,27859.08002
So Kayla Baron responded that she'll make it so.,27859.08002,27861.5
And you can take a very good for me.,27893.52,27895.51498
Right?,27895.51498,27895.835
For you as well.,27895.835,27896.47498

I'm good.,27896.79498,27897.455
Alright.,27900.79498,27901.115
I'm pretty straight a little bit.,27901.115,27902.655
And today's spacewalk has concluded at two twenty six PM central time three twenty six PM eastern time totaling six hours and fifty four minutes.,27907.08,27916.535
"As a fun fact, this is the exact time of the Spacewalk that occurred just eight days ago to the minute.",27916.835,27925.22
One PSI on the gauge?,27932.94498,27934.645
"Yep at four psi, you'll expect an alert tone.",27938.38,27940.86
"When we get to five psi, I'll be stopping the depress for a two minute leak check.",27940.86,27946.4
Okay.,27947.365,27947.865
The spacewalk just eight days ago was Rajatari's first spacewalk of his career clocking in at six hours and fifteen four minutes.,27966.335,27974.195
Today was his the second spacewalk of his career.,27974.72,27977.75998
So he has essentially doubled his spacewalking time.,27977.75998,27980.5
"It's like the the TSC, you can paste it if it if you want faster, you can Yep.",27986.845,27994.8

"Just confirming, you said a little bit faster?",28001.815,28003.975
Yes.,28003.975,28004.475
The crew lock just approach two psi.,28013.72,28015.9
"When the pressure approach is five PSI, the crew can expect a momentary hold.",28016.175,28021.795
"You have enough room with you, so I can put me wherever you want at this point.",28030.815,28034.675
Very good.,28034.815,28035.615
"If you need more room, just put me around.",28035.615,28037.695

It happened.,28051.635,28052.375
"When when you entered, when you picked up the keypad card.",28053.075,28057.015
Let me just see if they're wet on the inside when we get out.,28057.45,28063.95

Rajatari went on to replace two hoses on the radiator beam valve module.,28203.12,28207.06
"It had previously been leaking, but the space station's other radiators were able to do their job and keep the space station cool.",28207.12,28213.365
Chari's work replacing these hoses improved the performance of the station's radiators and gave us more wiggle room in case any of the hoses were to become faulty in the future.,28213.985,28222.35
The team also replaced an old camera with a high definition camera and brought it online.,28222.81,28226.83

Although our ground IVs are expediting the removal of Matias Mars suit space suit because they noticed an excess of water in his helmet.,28969.285,28976.68
"The ground the crew here on the ground reports that Matias Mar is in good health and is in no danger with the excess water, but they are interested in collecting that water just to see how much ended up there.",28977.14,28988.215
"Station Houston, on one, we see the helmet is off.",29089.52,29093.68

"Can we get some more clarification on the water that is at the vent port, the the size of the droplets?",29169.9,29176.24
Copy the photos.,29184.06497,29184.865
"Also, we'd like you to remove the half and take photos of the hap, especially if you can get a thickness, from a side view.",29184.865,29192.12003
You're looking over the shoulder of Tom Marshburn as he removes that helmet absorption pad for some quantitative analysis.,29201.74503,29207.88
Alice is a maybe another way to describe the amount of water on the helmet.,29216.345,29219.625
Tom said there's about thirty to fifth three zero to five zero percent of the visors coated with with a layer of water.,29219.625,29226.45

"Matias Marr, and took documentation, took some photos and some visual reports of the inside of the water in his helmet.",29299.58,29306.845
Baron is removing the gloves now while Tom Marshburn is stowing away the helmet of option pad so that the crew can look at it at a later time.,29318.635,29325.99
We're in a brief handover period.,29375.325,29377.105
"However, the ground team here working the spacewalk is thinking up ways that they can get more data from the crew, whether that's looking at Matias Mars head, or parts of his space suit so that they can determine just how much water was found.",29377.325,29391.625
"In the meantime, Kayla Baron is gonna be working to get our astronaut, Rajatari, out of the crew lock and into the equipment",29392.325,29400.0
Talk.,29400.0,29400.5
We're back now with live views of the equipment law and Rajatary just had his saper unit removed from his space suit.,29440.289997,29447.285
Both of our space walking astronauts are now back in the crew lock in the equipment lock section of the Quest Air Lock.,29706.82,29713.355
"When Matias Mar entered the crew lock, it was entered the equipment lock.",29714.215,29719.25
"It was noted that Mar had water in his helmet at no time was he in any danger, but Mar and Mar did not know any discomfort during the EVA itself.",29719.25,29728.265
The crew is going to continue to take documentation of the water for analysis by the ground team.,29730.005,29734.87

The helmet absorption pad that went inside of Matias Mars helmet has been stowed away for further analysis.,29796.435,29803.17
"The ground crew will look at that, as well as other data that the crew provides, including they were at the wetness of his head and possibly the levels of his onboard consumables, like the water he was drinking.",29803.55002,29815.395
All of this plus more will be used to help the ground crews here determine the cause and how much water ultimately ended up in his helmet.,29815.855,29823.38
But Matias is now safe in the equipment lock section of the Quest airlock with his helmet off.,29823.6,29829.02502
The ground here was made aware of this water only after Matias Mauer was in the equipment lock.,29890.555,29896.79498
He did not know feeling any water in his helmet during the spacewalk himself.,29896.79498,29900.73

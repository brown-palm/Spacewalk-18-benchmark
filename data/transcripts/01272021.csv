"Twenty one, to complete upgrades to the Columbus module of the space station.",12.455,16.475
"You're looking live into the airlock of the International Space Station, where NASA astronaut, Mike Hopkins, and Victor Gloverver, are preparing for today's spacewalk.",36.67,46.755
The crew is running about fifty minutes ahead of schedule this morning.,48.829998,52.37
"And as you can see here, NASA Ashena in the center of the screen, Victor glover, is getting his SAFER installed by NASA astronaut, Kate Rubins, and Jaxa, or Japanese aerospace exploration agency, Suichi Naguchi.",59.155,73.06
The safer or simplified aid for EVA rest you is essentially a jet pack that the astronauts wear when they perform spacewalks.,78.965004,86.15
Safer is worn as a cautionary measure in the unlikely event that an astronaut were to become untethered from the space station.,87.97,94.534996
"NASA astronaut, Mike Hopkins, who you can see above Victor in the suit with the red stripes, already has his SAFER on, and he's in the second portion of the airlock.",100.55,109.665
This will be Victor glover's first space walk of his career after arriving aboard the SpaceX crew Dragon resilience with Mike Hopkins in November.,122.14,129.715
During today's spacewalk Hopkins and glover will focus on completing cable and antenna rigging for the Bartolomeo science payloads platform outside of the European Space Agency Columbus module.,134.39,145.41501
The duo will also configure a KA band terminal that will enable an independent high bandwidth communication link to European ground stations.,147.07501,155.12001
"After completing these grades on the Columbus module, Hopkins and Glover will remove a grapple fixture bracket on the far port truss of the station in preparation for future power system upgrade.",157.82,168.655
"Based on updated guidance, Teams and mission control will now wear masks at all times while on console and supporting mission operations, except for brief periods of time to eat or drink.",190.66,201.39
As in my eye during today's spacewalk.,201.79,203.49
In preparation for today's spacewalk Spacewalk Officer Sarah Corona narrated an overview of the spacewalk today.,252.925,260.24
Let's take a look.,260.3,261.44
"US EVA coal upgrades is going to begin with EV one, egressing the Questair lock first.",266.70502,272.885
"The crew is going to be bringing out with them the Kalka, which stands for the Columbus KA band antenna.",273.52,280.42
This hardware is going to be installed on the Columbus module during this EVA.,281.22498,286.04498
EV one is going to translate out to the Columbus module via the translation path you can see here.,286.905,292.79
And we'll need to set up a few things at the work site before that installation.,294.13,298.23
"EV two is going to translate to an external platform called ESP two, where he is going to be ingressing the SSRMS, the robotic arm.",299.38498,309.50998
The robotic arm is going to be taking him over to the Columbus worksite with the polka So the crew members are gonna meet up at the worksite.,309.72998,319.355
They need to remove bolts that are on the Columbus panels.,319.895,323.995
Where those bolts are removed is where the co pay is going to be installed.,325.49002,329.99002
So they work together securing co pay to the Columbus module.,330.45,334.15002
"Once it is secure, b b two is going to route the cabling for that polka and plug it into the Columbus module.",337.865,347.41
"Meanwhile, EV one is going to head to the Bartolomeo form.",348.19,353.035
So Bartlemeo is an external platform in which payloads can be installed.,353.975,359.435
There are plants that need to be opened up in order to remove the cabling that needs to get routed in order to activate the bartle male form so the crew works together to get those cables routed and installed.,360.935,375.33502
EV one also needs to remove another set of labeling that is going to hook up an antenna for Barto La mayo that you can secure.,376.435,385.00998
"Once Barto Lomeo is complete, the crew members are going to go back to the polka and remove a cover.",386.31497,392.81497
So the cover was installed in order to protect the antenna during installation.,393.435,397.63998
"Since it's no longer needed, we are going to have EV two jettison that cover while he's on the SSRMS.",399.3,406.905
And once the activities are complete.,415.98,418.0
"At the Columbus worksite, both crew members meet back up at the Quest Airlock.",418.86002,422.80002
"They reconfigures some bags to take out with them for their next task, which is going to be out at the port most section of the space station trust.",423.565,435.08
They're going to be heading out to p six.,435.22,437.8
You can see the translation path here.,438.18,440.68
And the crew members are going to be removing an h fixture.,441.255,444.155
So this h fixture is not needed on the solar arrays.,444.615,449.035
So we're going to remove that h fixture.,449.25,451.35
Both of them are going to be removing one of them.,453.41,455.99002
And this plate is going to be removed because it's going to be where a future upgrade of the solar arrays is going to be installed.,456.85,466.16498
"So the plates are removed, put into a bag, and they will be brought back inside.",468.1,473.40002
After the EVA.,475.82498,476.805
"So once both crew members are complete with that, they both head back to the Quest Air and we have completed the plan tests for the UDA.",477.905,485.72998
"If there is some time at the end of the UDA, we will have some get aheads for the crew to perform.",485.94998,491.465
And those are the tasks you can look forward to during today's spacewalk.,502.15,505.93

"We'll be able to get the levers to, like, straight up and down, hop forward so they go over center.",13680.63,13685.85
"I'm trying to get a better eye level, to see if there's they're maybe not fully mated when I started moving the lever, but they all look like they're All the way you made it.",13686.275,13698.51
We copy.,13704.555,13705.375
"And I if you haven't already, you could inspect the lever for FOD?",13733.74005,13738.59503
It worked.,13743.85504,13744.515
"And while you're looking at it, you can also look at that linkage for any damage.",13746.75,13750.29004
Works.,13755.685,13756.185
"Oh, far.",13771.125,13771.605

It goes full forward over center while I've got it off.,13772.64496,13776.185
Copy.,13779.285,13779.785
So you can try and mate it again.,13785.1,13786.7
Just checking the align and the side load side loads.,13787.02,13790.26495
"And if you need to, you can push and pull on the back shelf and increase the force on the lever.",13790.485,13795.545
I will,13799.46497,13800.0
Try all of that again.,13800.0,13801.3
I tried all of those things.,13802.08,13804.26
I've got a handrail here on the end cone of Columbus that I'm using to reactivate.,13807.7149997,13811.975
I'm putting a good bit of force into it.,13814.68,13817.02
Yeah.,13831.84,13832.08
So j one and p one are fully mated with the lever aft over center.,13832.08,13837.06
"And then I go to lever forward, and it just stops at the midpoint levers perpendicular to the back shell right now as far as I can get it.",13837.600002,13848.695

"And I could just want to confirm when you're sliding down, the plug onto the jack that the two half shells are are meeting in a good mate.",13906.850006,13917.15501
That's weird.,13920.11,13920.67
"When I say it's mated with the lever half, that's what I'm talking about.",13920.67,13923.549995
They're flush.,13923.549995,13924.45
Yeah.,13924.99,13925.31
"It it is completely, centered up and ready to move the lever forward, and that's why I got a better eye level view to make sure I could see both sides that they were completely flushed together They're not quite symmetric, and the blue lines don't line up if you're familiar with these connectors, but if they were ready for me to move the lever, I would say for all four There's no, hang no.",13925.31,13948.15501
They're they're not sideways or anything.,13948.15501,13950.015

Sometimes there's a little bit of tightness that you need to overcome in the very last little bit of the the mate.,13990.57,13996.17001
"You kinda have to push both on the jack and the plug side and just kinda get it to to to, like, click into place.",13996.17001,14003.405

"Do you, Harper and I do have a an estimate of how far, it's engaging in the, yeah, the back shell is engaging when you throw the the the lever.",14587.17499,14599.57
Okay.,14605.935,14606.335
So let me describe the back shell.,14606.335,14608.435
Do you.,14610.4,14611.14
So there's a an outer part.,14612.16,14614.18
It's kinda got the gold coloring.,14615.2,14616.82

Alright.,21429.56,21430.06
I you can open the thermal cover And then you can stow the MLI and the small small adjustable and the large small adjustable in the crew lock and then you can retrieve crew lock bag number two and crew lock bag number three.,21430.52945,21451.75
You can temp stow two number two outside.,21452.45,21454.61002
It goes to hopper when he gets back.,21454.61002,21456.47
Yeah.,21462.85498,21463.095

"Now nearly five hours into today's spacewalk, which began at five twenty eight AM central time.",21473.26498,21478.965
The crew first took out the Colca or Columbus KA band antenna from the crew lock and brought it with him to the Columbus module.,21480.31,21487.13
"There, they removed bolts on the Columbus panels in order to install install the Colka, and then Colka was installed and secured to the Columbus module.",21487.815,21496.875
"Following this NASA astronaut, Victor glover, routed Calka cables, and the duo headed to the Bartolomeo science platform.",21498.58002,21505.32
And that's attached to a month.,21505.955,21507.97498
"NASA astronaut Mike Hopkins completed Barta La Mayo cable mating, but was unable to fully lock down the cable and so has wire tied them in place.",21508.275,21516.62
He's now performing cleanup of the area.,21517.39996,21519.74
"That's, identical attached to the v ring.",21519.96,21523.42
One end is attached.,21524.185,21525.485

And removed another set of cabling and routed it to an antenna on Bartolomeo.,21532.06,21536.0
That's where the wire tie caddy came from.,21536.13995,21537.77997
I think right.,21537.77997,21538.22
"The crew then removed a cover off the coker, which was in all to protect the antenna during installation.",21538.22,21543.315
"And because the c cover was no longer needed, it was jettisoned.",21544.015,21547.155
"Glover then translated back to the airlock and is now configuring bags that will be needed for the next part of this spacewalk, which will occur out at the P6 truck.",21548.44995,21557.345
"The final task of the day will be to remove a h fixture, which is a robotic interface that is no longer needed.",21558.225,21564.36
The crew will remove four four bolts and work together to remove the plate from the structure.,21564.83997,21569.98
This will open for attach points that will be used for future solar array power system upgrades.,21570.6,21575.965
And we did receive good words.,21578.73,21580.49

Sounds like a good inventory.,21677.520004,21678.82
So just the gaps spanner is missing.,21679.36,21681.38
Yeah.,21683.924995,21684.244995
"Scratch missing and the camera is sitting on a handrail, and I'll put that on me, because I'll need a preage fixture.",21684.244995,21690.744995
Copy.,21692.04,21692.54
Alright.,21701.185005,21701.685005
Now I gotta put all this back in the bag.,21701.745,21703.845
Okay.,21824.20001,21824.6
"So I'll just close this one and just, the gaps spanner.",21824.6,21827.98001
"As a reminder, you can submit your questions to us today using the hashtag ask NASA, and we'll be answering them live on air.",21843.34,21851.435
Good This split view of our two space walkers today.,21887.245,21890.47
"On the right, you have NASA astronaut, Victor glover's helmet cam.",21890.47,21894.38998
He's currently in the airlock configuring some crew lock bags for the next portion of today's spacewalk.,21894.38998,21899.545
"And on the left, you have Mike Hopkins who's working to translate and make his way back to the airlock to join Glover.",21899.845,21906.41
"Once the two meet up at the airlock, they'll work to translate to the p six truss in which they'll be removing an h fixture, which is no longer needed.",21914.595,21923.335
Yep.,21934.075,21934.315
You're right.,21934.315,21935.055
"And they're about to stow the inline adjustables and are small and small small and grabbing the crew lock back for us, but maybe you're getting a snack.",21935.595,21945.02002
I wish It's snack time?,21945.72,21947.785
It is definitely snack time.,21947.785,21949.565
"I would have thought that, air rubens would have had snacks in the airlock.",21954.7,21960.0
Just this kind of an event.,21963.395,21965.095
We thought that might be mean to show you guys the room inside the window.,21965.955,21969.335
We have snacks for you later.,21973.68,21975.12
Don't worry.,21975.12,21975.86002
Question is does Reagan have bacon up here?,21979.91498,21982.495
"Oh, man.",21982.79498,21983.615
One we've gotta figure out.,21988.41998,21990.03998
Yeah.,21990.74,21991.24
You heard the crew joking about wanting bacon and snacks during this spacewalk.,22005.16,22009.34
"After nearly five hours in a spacewalk of grueling work, you would be hungry.",22009.56,22013.74
"While the crew does not have food inside this spacesuit, they do have an in suit drink bag, which is a plastic water filled pouch, which attaches to the inside of the suit using Velcro.",22014.175,22023.715
Which they are able to bite down and drink during the space walk.,22024.03998,22027.18
Okay.,22029.15997,22029.63998
I expect three walk bag.,22029.63998,22031.18
Gonna put the gaps spanner in.,22031.715,22033.57498
Awesome.,22033.715,22034.215
Coming out of the crew lock now.,22036.115,22037.635
It shouldn't So both of works from lock bags.,22037.635,22040.86
Yeah.,22041.32,22041.82

"Andrew, I don't know if you guys were downlink in the airlock camera, but there was a cool shot of Iike coming out.",22124.23,22129.35
So I've moved the airlock camera to the window if you guys are interested.,22129.35,22134.85504
K.,22137.955,22138.275
We'll try and take a look.,22138.275,22139.655
May I have the correct bag.,22163.39,22164.59
One now includes a gas spanner.,22164.59,22166.685
Excellent.,22168.90497,22169.40497
"And I think you said, a camera was on handrail.",22170.105,22172.925
"So once you grab that, then you can grab the crew lock hit back to the airlock.",22172.985,22176.33997
I'm gonna go turn around and take a look at the have to configure the cables real quick.,22178.32,22184.755
Right?,22184.755,22185.255
Yep.,22185.635,22186.115
That's right.,22186.115,22186.835

"As a reminder, we are taking your questions today using the hashtag ask NASA.",22187.475,22192.215
"We did have one come in, where someone wanted to know how the astronauts carry the tools they need during this spacewalk.",22192.42,22198.12
You actually just saw a great,22198.57996,22200.0
"View of the mini workstation, which is kind of like a backpack that the crew members use in order to carry all their supplies.",22200.08,22206.02
"It has the tethers, and all the other necessary equipment that they need during this spacewalk.",22206.56,22211.155
K.,22211.695,22212.014999
Kamley is now attached to my swing arm.,22212.014999,22214.355
And my n w s.,22215.41,22217.35
"Hey, Ike.",22241.935,22242.675
"We wanted to give you an offer of, doing the airlock hatch pin hip pin R and R activity, which is one of the get aheads, while you're waiting for a hopper to get back.",22244.015,22255.735
I just wanted to know what you think about starting on that.,22255.815002,22259.515
Good to help.,22262.055,22263.435
Let me know what I need to do.,22263.88,22265.5
That's crew lock bag four.,22267.4,22268.76
Right?,22268.76,22269.26
That's affirm.,22269.8,22270.6
Yep.,22270.6,22270.84
So you can go ahead and grab crew lock bag number four.,22270.84,22273.575
Four.,22280.534996,22280.615
I wanna get four.,22280.615,22281.755
Two and three attempts still on the circular handrail.,22282.21,22284.549995
Copy.,22285.89,22286.29
SSC four.,22286.29,22287.19
"Okay, Andy.",22291.34499,22292.145
"The, you know, the only thing I could be doing here is, you know, potentially, just using that long wire side.",22292.145,22299.685
"And, you know, I'm kinda finishing up the cleanup here on the wire side, but if you guys aren't worried about the big loops, Looking around.",22301.24,22310.325005
"I put one twist on it and then needed to get off when, Yeah.",22321.89,22332.935
How hopper the the the main worry is from robo.,22332.935,22337.3
"So if we could get the cables as flushed to Columbus, without any kind of loops sticking up that'd probably be best.",22337.92,22345.525
Okay.,22349.425,22349.925
"Well, NASA astronaut, my Hopkins translate to the airlock NASA Victor glover is going to work on a get ahead task involving an airlock hatch pit pin R and R, essentially what he's going to do during this procedure is remove a broken pin in the airlock and replace it with a new functioning pin.",22390.49,22408.28
"The new pin the EVA scissors and then a trash bag, which I think you have on your mini workstation.",22408.82,22416.175
Correct.,22420.0,22420.5
And so the new pit pin and the EVA system should be on one side of the divider in the crew lock bag number four.,22421.44,22427.38
Yeah.,22429.695,22429.93501
"I see them, and they are on the same side of the divider.",22429.93501,22432.35501
Should I do this from inside the airlock or outside?,22432.57501,22435.07501
Yeah.,22443.95,22444.27
I get sort of half in half out whatever you think it's the best position to give you access.,22444.27,22449.175
So the first step would be to remove the old pit pin and then to insert the new pit pin.,22449.175,22455.595
Happy.,22461.19,22461.69
"K, Andy.",22534.355,22534.915
I'm down near the headbands.,22534.915,22537.335
Wanna give me a talk on.,22538.355,22539.975
Copy.,22542.035,22542.535

Standby.,22564.00998,22564.50998
And we just received word that the two cables that have been connected to the Bartolomeo external research science platform appear to be providing good electrical continuity and power as the crew presses ahead toward removing the h fixture on the p six truss.,22597.15,22612.85498
This view from NASA astronaut Victor glover's helmet cam as he works on a get ahead task.,22685.41,22690.78998
In order to remove and replace a broken pip pin inside the airlock.,22691.13498,22696.115
Alright.,22714.66504,22715.065
And you got one more loop.,22715.065,22716.445
Copy offer.,22719.63,22720.53
"Alright, Ike.",22764.89496,22765.71497
So it the the pit pin with a loose lanyard should be on the forward hinge.,22766.25494,22770.73
And it should be pointing aft.,22774.655,22776.09503
K.,22776.09503,22776.335
Hold on for a second.,22776.335,22777.215
I just hold on.,22777.215,22779.455
"I just, let the bag go back into the through lock the accident.",22779.455,22784.0
"Hey, hopper.",22838.05,22838.87
"That, we have an excellent camera view that looks really good.",22839.01,22841.649998
We're happy with cables.,22841.649998,22843.015
K.,22845.475,22845.875
"I got, some more quick wire tie here, and I'll be moving on my way.",22845.875,22851.015
One of them seems quite a bit longer than the others.,22852.27,22855.09
"The one on top, I don't know if that's design and not, but see in the views.",22855.629997,22862.745
Quite a bit extra loop.,22868.119995,22869.58
Okay.,22884.56,22884.88
So it's gonna have one move.,22884.88,22885.96
Are you okay with that?,22885.96,22887.22
It's kinda thickened up.,22889.345,22890.885
Want me to try and get those?,22891.825005,22893.445
"That looks, excellent, hopper.",22900.18,22902.1
We're happy with that.,22902.1,22903.06
That loop is where the other connectors are.,22903.14,22906.185
So we don't think that'll be a problem.,22906.185,22908.045
K.,22910.185,22910.685
That's good.,22912.0,22912.56
I've got one in the airlock.,22912.56,22913.94
"Okay, Andy.",22915.04,22915.84
I'm ready.,22915.84,22916.58
Okay.,22918.32,22918.8
So it should be the forward hinge Four hinge.,22918.8,22927.025
"And then there should be a a pit pin pointing aft on that forward hinge, so towards the middle of the airlock.",22929.67,22936.25
Ali?,22938.915,22939.415
It should have a loose lanyard.,22940.11499,22941.39499
I'm moving that one.,22941.39499,22942.275
It should have a loose lanyard.,22942.275,22943.655

It yeah.,22952.835,22953.955
"That one is, the one I believe you were talking about, but I don't see any miscellaneous.",22953.955,22959.41501
Line here looks normal.,22966.06999,22967.37
So we we think that the tent is broken.,22967.75,22969.90999
So does it didn't just kind of freely come out.,22969.90999,22973.34499
"And, Mike, you can try to pull on the pit pin itself.",22985.62999,22987.97
Tell if I'm pulling the okay.,22994.315,22996.315
"It's supposed to make you released, so that's why I was pulling the lanyard.",22996.315,22999.21501
"I don't think it just comes out, but when I pull the pip in part, supposed to make it release, it comes out.",23000.84999,23006.70999
You can get out of the eighth of an inch before it actually started to come out.,23008.365,23013.505
Yeah.,23016.51999,23016.76
I understand.,23016.76,23017.42
Yeah.,23017.8,23018.3
So it it's it's behaving like it should.,23019.0,23022.22
I think so.,23024.905,23025.80501
"Hey, Ike.",23039.94499,23040.425
Will you give us an ins inspection of the other three pit pins?,23040.425,23043.305
So there should be four in total.,23043.305,23044.745
So just kind of pull on all all four of them just to see if any of them pop out.,23044.745,23048.605
Work.,23058.945,23059.445
The aft hinge aft end lanyard is kinda wrapped around the hinge.,23077.14502,23082.265
"So that one, I'm not able to too much with managers kinda holding it in place.",23082.265,23087.49
"The pit portion of it seems to still have some spring to it, and I don't know if it's and pull it to see if it's engaged or not, though, because the lanyard's holding it down so tightly.",23089.15,23098.855
Forward pin on the at hand is fine.,23100.915,23103.17502
Forward came on the forward hinge seems fine too.,23127.18,23129.75998
Copy.,23132.255,23132.755
Sounds like we might have four good PIP pins.,23132.975,23135.45502
Give a second to discuss.,23135.45502,23136.755
If you do.,23139.49,23140.38998
"Hey, Eric.",23161.93997,23162.68
Could you could you go back to the first pit pin.,23163.37997,23166.905
"So the forward hinge, pit pin pointing aft, the one that we checked initially, and just try to pull on the pit pin itself, not the lanyard.",23167.045,23176.48
We just wanna double check because that's the one that was reported broken.,23176.7,23180.16
Okay.,23182.815,23183.315
"I just wanna so if you can see, I'll make sure to get it inside this, but get the tip in so there's a part of it that you pull to make it come out.",23183.375,23191.95502
I'm trying to not pull on that part to make sure that it's staying in where it's supposed to.,23192.5,23196.68
It does not you don't want me to just release it not only by the pit pin.,23197.7,23200.82
It's supposed to.,23200.82,23201.765
That's correct.,23202.24503,23202.98502
Yeah.,23203.20502,23203.445
That's right.,23203.445,23204.005
Exactly.,23204.005,23204.40503
We don't want you to depress the little plunger on top.,23204.40503,23208.345
"You know, we just wanna try pull without Yes.",23208.725,23211.7
Disengaging the the detent.,23213.12003,23215.06003
Yeah.,23217.875,23218.375
Okay.,23218.51498,23218.835
"Well, the puncture is like a whole top portion.",23218.835,23221.715
So it's truly easy to grab the plunger part.,23221.715,23227.12
Okay.,23227.12,23227.36002
I don't know if you can see it in our video.,23227.36002,23229.38
So this entire part the cross portion moves.,23230.08002,23234.395
"And if I pull that, it comes right out.",23234.395,23236.335
That's the pit tipping part.,23236.63498,23238.57498
"So I've been pulling on the cable for lanyard, but I'm not pulling on the pin.",23239.195,23245.37997
"I'm talking it pretty good, guys.",23245.91998,23247.43997
I'm I am pulling hard on this thing.,23247.43997,23249.345
"If it was loose, it would slide out.",23249.425,23251.285
"If I pull on the tip portion, it will come out.",23253.265,23256.245
That's what I would expect to happen.,23256.305,23258.005
Could you see that?,23258.065,23259.125
Yeah.,23263.25,23263.65

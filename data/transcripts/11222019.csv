"It's just if you've already got the hatch, you're just trying to recover it back to the filter.",5425.07,5429.995
Am I asking if you do it?,5429.995,5431.535
Copy.,5431.755001,5432.075
Thanks for relaying that.,5432.075,5433.375

"No, like, great job, Luca and Drew.",5475.13,5476.81
It's good to work.,5476.81,5477.625
So first step is we're switching power to bat.,5477.705,5480.585
I want you to stagger those throws.,5480.585,5482.365
"Expect a warning tone, and then check display switch functional.",5482.905,5487.25
Okay.,5490.75,5491.25
I'm back too bad.,5492.189995,5496.885
"Okay, Drew.",5498.865005,5499.665
On the UIA switch power e v one and two to off.,5499.665,5503.939995
OFS.,5504.479996,5504.979996
"And that, Jeremy, my display is not functional.",5510.955,5514.975
And then battery.,5516.44,5517.5
Okay.,5518.2,5518.7
Alright.,5518.92,5519.42
Standby.,5519.72,5520.22
Give me a phone in a Whirlpool.,5533.66501,5534.95
"I got a tone, but now, I don't.",5535.59,5538.55
Alright.,5538.55,5538.95
My green is blank.,5538.95,5540.81
"I mean, and that I don't think it's expected.",5542.62999,5544.65
"Okay, Drew.",5552.56,5553.36
"It's, this is we have a procedure for this.",5553.36,5556.0
We're just pulling it up.,5556.0,5556.8
I'm gonna step you through it.,5556.8,5558.0
So stand by one.,5558.0,5559.14
K.,5561.44,5561.94
IDN says this new power available.,5562.145,5565.125
"And, Luca, just for your awareness that that's expected.",5583.93001,5586.59001
Okay.,5588.57,5589.07
"Luca, you're displaying functional credit?",5613.785,5615.305
Yes.,5615.305,5615.545
"I say functional Okay, Drew.",5615.545,5641.005
"I just wanna make sure, you might as well pull up the cuff checklist page twenty eight.",5641.005,5646.365
It's the warm restart.,5646.365,5647.585
Copy.,5649.42,5649.74
I was expecting that because I'm gonna go to page k.,5649.74,5654.86
I'm on page twenty eight.,5654.86,5656.40002
Okay.,5656.785,5657.025
"And the whole key to this, procedure is that we're gonna talk through it before we actually execute all the steps because at some point, we're gonna lose comms We wanna make sure you're ready to get yourself back in a good config.",5657.025,5669.2
"And in the past, we have had helmets fog up, and you won't be able to see very well.",5669.66,5673.5
So those are our our consents.,5673.5,5674.96
So we'll step into this.,5675.215,5676.255
"So we'll just I'll read through it, and then I'll tell you when to execute.",5676.255,5679.715
K.,5681.695,5681.935
Copy.,5681.935,5682.435
And I just wanna check.,5690.855,5692.375
"We never confirmed, but on the have we executed the step on the UAA to switch the power off yet?",5692.535,5698.235
Alright.,5699.88998,5700.21
No.,5700.21,5700.45
"Make it up both UIA, EV one and EV two are power on.",5700.45,5704.31
"Okay, Drew.",5709.285,5710.005
"So I copied you are in bat on your suit, and that's what caused this.",5710.005,5714.32498
"And then the next step is to switch power, EV one and two to off, o f f, and check the LEDs arrow.",5714.32498,5720.33002
K.,5723.51,5723.83002
So do you want me to proceed with the the UIA EV one and two power off.,5723.83002,5729.675
Is that correct?,5729.675,5730.495
"Hey, affirmative.",5731.595,5732.255
Before we do any cop checklist step.,5734.68002,5737.1
That's right.,5738.2,5738.68002
"Because we believe you're you're still gonna have power at this step But eventually, we're gonna get to the point where we we do shut your power off.",5738.68002,5745.715
Okay.,5747.295,5747.77502
Copy.,5747.77502,5748.17502
So EV one power off on the UIA.,5748.17502,5751.475
And on the UIA Eighty two power off.,5752.31,5755.53
Okay.,5757.67,5758.15002
Just confirm the LED zero.,5758.15002,5759.85
The LEDs are up on EV one and EV two on the UIA.,5762.455,5766.63498
Okay.,5768.49,5768.99
Alright.,5769.05,5769.53
So here's where we talk about the big picture.,5769.53,5771.61
So we're gonna switch the fan and power off for seven seconds eventually.,5771.61,5776.59
"And then while the fan is off, you're gonna be without cooling and c o two removal, o overheating and loss of visibility are possible.",5777.16498,5784.865
There'll be no comm until you take the power back to that.,5785.85,5788.83002
"And if fan operation is delayed or not restored or power is not restored, after switching back to battery, then you can open and lock the helmet purge valve to restore vent flow.",5789.21,5801.585
"So right now, it's important to take a moment to confirm the location of the power fan switches by feel as you may not be able to see them.",5803.61002,5813.14502
Alright.,5818.87,5819.27
"And just to confirm, I'm gonna start at step six on page twenty eight checklist.",5819.27,5824.00998
Yeah.,5828.885,5829.205
That'll be where we're we're gonna pick up next.,5829.205,5831.54498
"So when we give you a go, you are gonna go ahead and switch the fan off.",5831.845,5837.12
You'll expect tones and a fan switch off message And then you're gonna switch the power to SCU.,5837.81998,5845.805
Just gonna power down the suit.,5845.945,5847.645
"It's gonna count seven seconds, and then you're gonna go power back to that.",5847.865,5851.965
"And then when the five second power restart is complete, then you can switch the fan on.",5852.81,5857.31
Yeah.,5861.035,5861.355
Copy all.,5861.355,5861.915
Standby for your go.,5861.915,5863.21503
"Okay, Drew.",5870.73,5871.37
So you're familiar with the switch locations by feel?,5871.37,5874.03
I am.,5876.89,5877.55002
"And then one final reminder, your final config when this is complete, all the switches are gonna be towards you.",5882.235,5888.9
Okay.,5889.2,5889.6
"You're go, Drew.",5889.6,5890.4
"We'll talk to you in, about ten or twenty seconds.",5890.4,5892.9
Okay.,5894.705,5894.94498
Copy.,5894.94498,5895.44498
And switch to A rescue.,5896.06497,5906.49
This morning's spacewalk officially began at six zero two AM central time as the space station was two flying two hundred and sixty five statute miles over the South Pacific East of Chile.,5917.3150000000005,5927.91

"And after this bundle of cables is released, he'll remove caps from the two cable connectors then mate those cables to some spacewalk cables using the same technique as you did to remove the caps.",9641.32,9652.645
"Luca, just a reminder that This is one option of cutting them.",9670.395004,9674.119995
"We can just go to cutting the heads off, if if you're having trouble getting access, getting the tool because they're so tight.",9674.119995,9681.02
Alright.,9681.645,9682.145
I think I'm gonna open up the m and I a little more.,9683.564995,9686.545

That's the reason it's the head of the my cutter.,9846.19,9851.49
Yeah.,9852.51001,9852.905
"You want us to trade and whatever you've got to read it to the LAN, dyno for the lancer here.",9857.945,9865.25
Hold on.,9865.47,9866.21002
Alright.,9867.47,9867.97
It's five or three in the past by now.,9884.025,9892.925
And did you say that the external ones are okay to drop Yeah.,9939.16498,9945.33
That's right.,9945.33,9945.88998
"The external one's not for loads, but light loads.",9945.88998,9948.61
It's the middle one that has a cable running down at Luca that we wanna avoid.,9948.61,9952.31
Okay.,9954.725,9955.225
"Zulu, I'm gonna try to answer this is.",9963.95,9966.21002

Okay.,9974.03497,9974.53497
Almost an hour and sixteen minutes into the space walk.,9989.335,9992.055
The space station has just flown past the west of the Hawaiian Islands.,9992.055,9997.02
"Nas Ash or East Ash and hot Luca Parma Tano, who you can see his helmet camera view here.",9997.96,10003.66
Designated by the number eleven in the bottom right hand corner continues to work to free some power cables from an upper beam.,10003.865,10011.16498
These cables will eventually route power from the station to the alpha magnetic spectrometer.,10011.40997,10015.59
Trying to use the lancer on the zip tie itself.,10018.665,10021.145
Yeah.,10021.145,10021.305
On the zip tie?,10021.305,10022.025
Yeah.,10022.025,10022.265
"We're we're fine with that, Luca.",10022.265,10023.785
"Obviously, you're gonna be careful not to cut the cable itself.",10023.785,10026.765
Save up another plan that I can you can use the diagonal cutters on just the head of the zip tie if you have access.,10035.195,10044.255
But we're fine with what you're doing.,10044.63998,10046.56
We trust you.,10046.56,10047.62

Yeah.,10052.47998,10052.88
I get what you mean.,10052.88,10054.02
"You know, Luke, I guess we were expecting that bundle to kind of pull out already after you undid that zip tie at the front.",10061.69,10068.11
But or the is there are there zip ties at the back that are holding it in?,10069.05,10073.60498
It's a couple of deep dives.,10080.85,10082.31
There are two deep dives that are holding me back.,10094.88998,10100.03
And they are wrapped around the two two bubbles and and to the structure.,10100.88998,10108.495
And so I just don't have enough space.,10110.235,10113.81
A little bit maybe now.,10115.47,10116.85

"I mean, we're we're doing good on time today.",10122.885,10124.885
"So just keep working through it, give us your best suggestions on how to proceed, but we're happy with how things are one.",10124.885,10130.74
We expected these to be a challenge.,10130.95996,10132.82
Somebody tucked them away thinking they would never be used again.,10133.52,10136.58
Sure.,10139.335,10139.735

Parmatino is going to use that connector tool to remove cap from two of the cables that we just saw.,10469.06,10475.175
He'll then mate the power cable using that same tool to the cables that were taken out on this spacewalk.,10476.355,10482.86
That's right.,10484.6,10485.34
"And you're aware it'll Oh, Let's start with the red and black cable.",10601.18,10618.99

"He will begin to mate those two cables to the spacewalk cables, the white ones you saw using the same technique.",10844.075,10850.095
"It's a tough task as these Cables were really only meant to be handled with hands on earth, not wearing spacewalk gloves, but as you saw, Primitano, with some help from Drew Morgan, was able to get the caps off, and, we will look forward to regaining video communication as he begins to make the two cables the next task this morning.",10851.115,10869.665
Alright.,10900.195,10900.595

Am I supposed see a little blue pattern popping out of the collar?,10937.41501,10941.71
"Luca, there's a window on the connector, and you you might be able to see the blue through that window.",10955.89,10961.03
Yeah.,10962.76999,10963.17
That's what I was talking about.,10963.17,10964.70999

I just want to make sure that I've I've got all the way.,10977.45999,10980.44
"Well, why don't you just pull it a little bit closer to the WVS and give us a little bit better look at that.",10980.9,10987.245
Tell me where to guide it.,10989.70499,10991.245
Tiny a bit up and closer if you can.,10991.94499,10994.605

"We we're guessing a bit here on the ground, but we think that you need to go just a tiny bit further than caller.",11014.87,11019.915
We think there should be a full dot in the window.,11020.215,11022.855
Does that make sense?,11022.855,11023.995
That's what I thought.,11026.935,11028.155
Pharmatano continues to work to tighten the first cable to the spacewalk cable brought out today.,11047.83,11054.17001

Three more.,12545.395,12546.135
Yeah.,12546.595,12547.075
Okay.,12547.075,12547.575
I see them there now.,12547.955,12549.175
That should be couple more here.,12555.33997,12557.27997
"Well, we'd, as Lucas, peeling this down, something I'm noticing is, we see some grounding tires, it looks like, on the surface of the beam where we'll be mounting the mat.",12573.35004,12585.635
Tapped on tapes in place and looks like in most places.,12587.09,12591.11005
Yep.,12596.02496,12596.345
"We're expecting those, Drew.",12596.345,12597.625
We think they're gonna be out of your way.,12597.625,12599.565
"But if you feel differently, let us know.",12600.0,12603.1399999
"Two hours into today's spacewalk, and things continue to proceed smoothly for the second spacewalk to repair the alpha magnetic spectrometer.",12661.364998,12669.145
"NASA astronaut, Andrew Morgan, and European Space Agency astronaut, Luca Parmatano, working now to free up some space on a beam just outside the vacuum case of the alpha magnetic spectrometer where they will later attach the mechanical attachment device which will hold the upgraded thermal tracker pump system to be installed on the next spacewalk.",12669.79,12693.35
"As much as, the way the wires are running, I don't know if that's I I would assume that would interfere with the Matt now thing.",12693.59,12699.935
So Yep.,12699.935,12703.215
We're talking about it.,12703.215,12704.31
Trying to decide whether we're gonna just move them out of the way or install over top.,12704.31,12708.25
Okay.,12711.27,12711.67
Those two there.,12711.67,12712.729996
A hole.,12714.485,12714.965004
Someone that should be it.,12714.965004,12716.245
"That's right, Drew.",12716.245,12717.205
Those are the next thing.,12717.205,12718.085
Let's cut those out.,12718.085,12719.305
Zoom's a hard to capture.,12737.86,12739.16
Don't have any need.,12740.74,12741.88
Alright.,12764.765,12765.265
"Station Court, Doing pretty well.",12765.485,12777.56999
Okay.,12778.43,12778.83
What do we do with this stuff?,12778.83,12780.37
So they're talking about.,12780.83,12782.12999
"So we'll figure out what we're gonna do, whether we're gonna scroll over or free up.",12783.035,12786.715
"Luke and Drew, what we're talking about here is the one that's in the middle there that runs through the rivets that probably shouldn't be an issue, but the one that's below it, you know, for you, down, for you, next one down at the bottom, That one, there's a we think the Mad is gonna make contact there.",12786.715,12802.815
We think we gotta move that one out of the way without cutting it ideally.,12802.815,12806.515
"We'll just, peel the tape and try and move it out of the way.",12806.61,12809.83
And to make sure that we're talking Yep.,12811.41,12814.785
I think he's there again.,12814.785,12815.745
"So, yeah, he's on the right one.",12815.745,12817.105
Take off.,12817.185,12817.665
Yeah.,12817.665,12817.905
That's the one we're talking about.,12817.905,12819.345
K.,12819.345,12819.845
Alright.,12821.425,12821.925
"Ah, this thing is really good.",12862.81,12864.43
"Yeah, Luca.",12914.11002,12914.75
"It looks like, you're in good shape there.",12914.75,12917.49
We think that will probably do it.,12917.79,12919.63
So that's a good starting position.,12919.63,12921.695
Let's see if we can get them out on.,12921.695,12923.475
Thank you.,12928.87,12929.51
That works for your man.,12929.67,12931.05002
We go right here for us.,12931.75,12936.79
"And, you want the little guy?",12936.79,12938.775

I want the upper man.,12939.01498,12940.475
K.,12940.535,12940.775
There's no Sorry.,12940.775,12941.655
"If I can, stop it.",12941.655,12945.79
Make sure those those little grounding wires.,12945.79,12951.2825
"Well, I gotta have pull those back.",12952.44666,12956.815
Yeah.,12956.815,12957.315
Yeah.,12957.695,12957.935
"I mean, I'm gonna be not so tall you could do that.",12957.935,12960.435
"A what do you think, Luca?",12961.455,12963.695
That's are capped on tape in the center of the ribbon.,12963.695,12966.18997
Do you think there's enough slack that if we undid those that we could move all of those grounding wires out to the side?,12966.18997,12972.655
I'm gonna just do that.,12972.735,12973.775
I'm gonna put them all over here.,12973.775,12975.475
Okay.,12976.01498,12976.255
And we're good with that plan.,12976.255,12977.695
That was the next suggestion.,12977.695,12979.475
"So if you think that's best, just go for it now.",12979.615,12982.355
Think so.,12983.84998,12984.25
"And I think we went up to slack to relocate them, but, you said the consequences they took.",12984.25,12989.94998
Of these wires was to get pulled.,12991.035,12992.895
How significant is that?,12993.915,12996.335
No.,12998.44998,12998.84998
It's not significant.,12998.84998,12999.83
"We, we're okay with actually cutting them if we have to, but this is the gold standard if we and keep them intact.",13000.21,13006.20502
Okay.,13008.265,13008.765
We're going for the gold.,13008.825,13010.20502
Here you go.,13033.08002,13033.90002

Alright.,13053.32498,13053.82498
What is the position?,13058.285,13059.425
Those wires feel like they're out of the way.,13061.34,13063.9
Yeah.,13063.9,13064.22
I think so.,13064.22,13065.12
Alright.,13065.18,13065.68
No.,13069.005,13069.325

I missed that.,13805.2,13806.18
Nine ninety three.,13809.295,13810.515
Okay.,13811.615,13812.015
And how accurate do you think your initial turn count of four could have been higher?,13812.015,13815.955
"Email's higher, probably.",13819.29,13820.83
Yeah.,13821.21,13821.61
"And, yeah, I'd verify that we would, we were up about four on most.",13821.61,13826.425
Yeah.,13827.605,13828.005001
Okay.,13828.005001,13828.405
Alright.,13828.405,13828.905
Yeah.,13832.965,13833.285
Nine four four.,13833.285,13834.345
I've got a new counter.,13835.469997,13836.91
"So, this one was about five.",13836.91,13840.129997
Got unturned and eight point one daylight.,13845.585,13850.964996
Okay.,13852.4,13852.88
"Copy, Luca.",13852.88,13853.78
"And, I mean, from what what we can see in the video, it sounds seems like these bolts are behaving very well.",13854.56,13859.395
"Smooth, running torque, etcetera.",13859.555,13861.415
Yeah.,13863.155,13863.655
They are.,13866.435,13867.895004
"By, come a little a little bit to your right.",13868.99,13871.17
There you go.,13872.27,13873.09
Four turn green light.,13883.825005,13886.165
Eight point three.,13886.62,13887.76
Copy.,13889.66,13890.16
That's four number eight.,13891.58,13892.880005
It's for both numbers three.,13894.62,13896.32
"Five turns, eight point four torque, green light.",13906.560005,13909.86
Copy.,13910.8,13911.3
Three four four number six?,13915.735,13917.355
During the half turn eight point three green light.,13927.2,13930.52501
Copy.,13931.46501,13931.96501
"Hold number two two turns, eight point three green light.",13936.74501,13947.395
Copy.,13948.435,13948.935
For number five And what is the quarters?,13954.195,13963.35
Yeah.,13964.13,13964.485
Point two green light.,13964.565,13966.345
Copy.,13967.525,13968.025
"Last voltage is number seven One and one tenth, eight point two three light.",13972.405,13983.06
Okay.,13984.79501,13985.27501
"Copy that, Luca.",13985.27501,13986.15501
"You can go ahead and remove the the rest of the tethers from the mat through the the ret as you know, with is going over to the diagonal beam handrail for cutting guides.",13986.15501,13997.58
And the ret is on the the dangle beam handrail.,14001.635,14005.015
"And, we don't wanna say from my eye see everything from the side and the black lines on all the bolts.",14005.635,14011.31
"Four through eight are, are very not visible.",14011.53,14014.82999
So they all went down symmetrically very nicely.,14014.96999,14017.39
Alright.,14018.425,14018.745
Let me let me turn it up right blue.,14018.745,14020.765
Okay.,14021.145,14021.645
"And, Drew, maybe if it's, like, easy for you to just run the camera around there.",14023.705,14028.62001
That'd be great for us.,14029.16,14030.54001
Yeah.,14033.88,14034.36
"Actually, I will do a stills, Luca, if you could, do the Yeah.",14034.36,14040.295
GoPro.,14040.455,14040.935
"Go for the of my GoPro's, across the way here.",14040.935,14044.875
We work.,14046.53,14047.34999
Okay.,14052.625,14052.945
"And, Luca, we don't wanna spend much time on photos for you or camera work for you.",14052.945,14057.905
"So next, we're moving on with the that long wire tie that you stay previously, we're gonna use that to tie down the MOI and the wire to the forward Parmantano and Morgan confirming that the lower mad is installed, all eight of those bolts have secured it to the beam near the vacuum case.",14057.905,14085.53998
Attach to the to the meds.,14087.935,14089.45502
So let me do that.,14089.45502,14090.755
"Okay, Luca.",14092.975,14093.61502
You're ready to go off.,14093.61502,14094.52
The original ret is on the bank of Humana.,14094.68,14097.02
Cable here and it came from the mat.,14102.045,14103.64502
Okay.,14103.64502,14103.96503
"It's been, buddy.",14103.96503,14104.785
Pretty much.,14104.845,14105.665
"And Jamie, okay.",14115.94,14117.46
So confirm again the instruction.,14117.46,14119.16
You want this MLI that's wrapped around on itself.,14120.285,14123.425
It'd be wrapped onto extract.,14124.525,14130.28998
Yeah.,14131.38998,14131.71
Not the MLI itself.,14131.71,14132.83
So what we wanna do is secure that cable bundle that you created earlier.,14132.83,14136.61
Somehow.,14136.995,14137.495
And what we're gonna do is m o or use the wire tie to the strut the forward strut.,14137.715,14142.935
"And then at the same time, you could put that wire tie around that bit of MLI just to make sure that we we keep it neat and tidy for when we bring the pump box out next DVA.",14143.07498,14154.47998
But that's really up to your discretion.,14154.785,14156.48502
Okay.,14158.14502,14158.64502
Okay.,14159.905,14160.30502
"By the MLI, does he does he need to go he doesn't go back to speed.",14160.30502,14165.37
No.,14167.19,14167.69
We don't really need to worry about the MLI so much except for ensuring it covers up the cable that you just installed and won't interfere with our pump box install.,14168.63,14177.41498
That's it.,14177.41498,14178.235
Okay.,14181.41498,14181.91498
The last question this.,14181.97498,14183.26
"Keep talking about the forward strap, but, for me, it's more, like, left and right.",14183.56,14188.7
Yep.,14190.305,14190.625
Let me just look at that one last time because you're upside down for me.,14190.625,14194.64502
"And, as long as it's not the middle strip, that's fine, Luca.",14199.91998,14203.86
Do what?,14209.16498,14209.82498
K.,14217.07,14217.31
"You know, I used the white tie to tie the cable to the original cable that I still mistied inside the the pocket.",14217.31,14226.85
And they're pretty stable.,14227.615,14229.555
So I don't I don't like I don't know that I can reach either strap from here.,14229.615,14235.2
I could wipe the to the days of the I could wear a tie if you want to the lower to the upper man.,14237.36002,14251.965
Is there a good compromise?,14253.61,14254.90997
Yeah.,14257.68997,14258.16998
"At the we think that's fine, Luca.",14258.16998,14260.11
"Remember, the goal here really is just to keep the cables covered by the MLI and the MLI under control.",14260.25,14265.605
So it sounds like what you're suggesting works.,14265.665,14268.165
"And, Luca, find that a little better.",14275.84998,14277.905
"So it's the cables that you pulled out where the connection is that we're trying to protect, but obviously, the the end of the cable you installed today has to come out.",14277.905,14285.59
It's gonna end up on the row you.,14285.59,14287.37
Right.,14291.03,14291.53
"That one is already temp stowed, and the connection I made between the old cables And the new cable, he's under the Mli, much as much as possible.",14291.805,14306.04
"I mean, and now It's white side on to the low battery man.",14306.04,14315.315
Luke and Drew were handed over in twenty five seconds.,14340.92004,14343.495
"And, Luke, I think I heard you say you've already got the other end of the cable temp temp stowed on the on the row u.",14343.575,14350.21497
So we have enough lanks to connect to the pump box?,14350.21497,14353.69
Yes.,14359.35,14359.745
That high.,14359.825,14360.625
I would say that.,14360.625,14361.765
Okay.,14363.185,14363.585
We're handing over.,14363.585,14364.625
I'll be back.,14364.625,14365.445
"Parmatano wrapping up the installation of the Mad and Mechanical attachment device and moving on to covering a cable that was recently attached earlier in the spacewalk under the MLI, which stands for multi layer insulation.",14373.01996,14386.78503
I bend over probably.,14393.16,14394.865
Sorry.,14397.48505,14397.885
"Say that again, Luca?",14397.885,14398.92505
Give me.,14398.92505,14399.585
Hey.,14400.79999995,14401.1999999
Do you should have a b a lot in the view of Yeah.,14401.1999999,14407.555
It's still connecting.,14407.555,14408.514999
We'll have it here in a moment.,14408.514999,14410.055
It's gonna be mine.,14412.594999,14413.815
With that adjustable that was on the mat is now in crew lock bag two.,14415.37,14419.55
"Copy, Drew.",14422.795,14423.695
Spacewalk clock now at two hours and thirty minutes.,14444.5,14447.72
Parmitano is taking some pictures of the work site.,14447.94,14450.84
Yeah.,14451.22,14451.535
We have video.,14451.535,14452.335
"After closing out things here, he will move up towards the same worksite he was at in the first space walk.",14452.335,14458.655
"We just need to hear your your viewpoint on it, and we're ready to move on.",14458.655,14462.27
"I think it's I think it's a bigger, a configured.",14463.77,14466.75
"It's going to be this may be, I might have to reconfigure this when I get here later on.",14466.89,14475.975
"Please, I can it's showing me the better.",14476.51,14481.97
Yeah.,14482.43,14482.75
"You know, better place up here.",14482.75,14484.575
"So you have a wire tie there from the last EVA, right, with the data cable, and you're putting it in with it?",14484.575,14490.274994
Yeah.,14490.494995,14490.994995
Yeah.,14492.26,14492.58
I'm gonna put it on top of the road.,14492.58,14494.6
"On the previous VA, I couldn't get up there.",14494.659996,14497.08
Yeah.,14497.939995,14498.34
That sounds good.,14498.34,14499.06
Not that I can.,14499.06,14500.119995
We just wanna make sure we're ready when we bring the pump box out to just slide a rate on in with no issues.,14500.755005,14505.735
I understand.,14508.115005,14508.775
I wanna do the same thing.,14508.83501,14510.06
This is you from Parmitano's helmet camera marked number eleven in the bottom right hand corner of your screen.,14540.945,14546.16501
Shows him stowing the cable he worked with earlier.,14546.19,14548.85
This cable eventually provide power to the alpha magnetic spectrometer.,14549.71,14553.01001
I believe we're done with that.,14629.645,14630.845
We got back to you for a little bit.,14630.845,14632.285
Is that right?,14632.285,14632.87
Let me double check.,14635.03,14636.40999
Hi.,14648.955,14649.27
Next time we need crew lock bag too that the nadir works at Drew.,14650.71,14653.93001
And wait.,14656.855,14657.335
I think that now I have a good temp stowing location for the the cables.,14657.335,14662.395
Okay.,14665.68997,14666.18997
Okay.,14666.40997,14666.81

"We copy that, Luca.",14688.26498,14689.54498
So we're finished up this work site.,14689.54498,14691.56497
That's affirmative.,14692.985,14693.72498
Give me four cycle it.,14693.94498,14695.52

"Luca, we just wanna confirm since we didn't get a good a good turn count on all those bolts.",14717.02002,14722.39502
I just wanna verify that we got them driven past the black line on all of the bolts.,14722.39502,14728.27
I can verify that the black line is not visible from any of the gold Okay.,14733.38998,14739.345
Good words.,14739.96503,14740.605

The first motion is going to be body out.,14758.345,14761.165
Be body out.,14763.305,14764.13
And starting motion.,14765.33002,14766.63
Motion.,14768.53,14769.03
"After ensuring all of the bolts are in their proper position to secure the Mad, the mechanical attachment device to the beam near the vacuum case, Parmatino is now moving again on the Canid arm two, controlled by NASA's Jessica Meer, who's inside the space station, to the next work site It's the same worksite he was at in the first spacewalk.",14773.485,14792.965
"Hey, now we're gonna bring you body up gonna be really small.",14795.505,14798.66
It's only about five centimeters.,14798.66,14800.04

"It'll be about forty centimeters Parmatonna's next task, a very important one.",14814.155,14821.91
He'll be cutting the current c o two line.,14821.97,14824.63
That has been cooling the alpha magnetic spectrometer.,14825.04498,14827.465
That's a six millimeter tube.,14827.525,14829.225
"Once he cuts that line, it will permanently disable the cooling system on the old tracker thermo control system.",14829.445,14835.52

"And now we're going to switch modes back to in toifax, and then we're gonna be bringing you station zenith about two meters.",14836.71997,14844.01498
So it brings people in you away from the work site.,14844.01498,14846.495
Okay.,14846.495,14846.995
"Jeremy, how are we doing on the top line?",14850.43997,14853.34

Just slightly behind.,14864.73,14866.03
"Hey, Luca.",14915.83496,14916.39496
Are you ready for that motion about two meters Venus?,14916.39496,14919.055
I am ready.,14919.515,14920.28
Okay.,14920.84,14921.24005

But I'm certain happy.,15038.65,15040.030003
Right?,15040.09,15040.59
"Copy, Luca.",15042.495,15043.395
"I need my, half is dry, and I've dealt with some previous on the gloves.",15046.094997,15052.65
I don't know how in those areas.,15053.19,15054.57
"Hey, Luca.",15055.345,15055.905003
We're gonna start this Joe Cas now bringing you that AMS common three point five minutes.,15055.905003,15060.005
Copy.,15060.305,15060.805
Any motion.,15061.265,15062.005
"Alright, Drew.",15065.88,15066.84
Another thing to stage is the cutting guides on that diagonal beam handrail.,15066.84,15071.259995
A good reminder.,15074.625,15075.445
"As the crew moves into place and prepares for their next task, we are still taking ask and ask a question.",15086.45,15092.61
"So if you're on Twitter, just use the hashtag ask NASA and submit your question.",15092.61,15096.935
This one comes from Tyler who wants to know more about the safer system and how it works.,15097.635,15102.695
Safer is attached to the suit.,15103.18,15105.26
It's actually stands for the simplified aid for EVA rescue.,15105.26,15108.64
It's a compressed and nitrogen powered backpack that allows a crew member to move on his or her own independently from the space station.,15109.1,15117.405
We hope to never see it used because it's primarily intended for use if a spacewalker becomes detached from the station and needs to maneuver back.,15117.945,15125.62
Another question from Stacy who wants to know why the signal sometimes cuts off during the spacewalk video coverage.,15171.56,15178.38
We are in communication with the International Space Station through something called TDRIS.,15178.925,15183.025
That's the tracking data data relay satellite system.,15183.325,15186.625
There are two types of communication with the station.,15187.13,15189.71
That's video and audio.,15189.85,15191.39
"And every now and then, the space station hands over from one satellite to enough to another.",15191.93001,15196.875
"And these changes in satellites are tracked by teams on the ground, so we know when we will, lose communication with the station and when we will regain it.",15197.17499,15205.78
Okay.,15235.4,15235.8
That's position hold.,15235.8,15236.84
We'll get set up for the next Jocast.,15236.84,15238.54
Copy.,15239.0,15239.5
"Another ask NASA question, this one from Mary, who asks about the equipment.",15289.19,15293.45
And if it's made to be able to be used with the gloves the astronauts are wearing.,15293.51,15298.155
They are a little bit bulkier to work with than normal human hands.,15298.455,15302.155
"And to help astronauts work in those bulky gloves, the suit pressurized to about four point three pounds per square inch.",15302.29498,15308.87
"The tools are specially designed to allow crew members to use them more easily, taking into account that it is more difficult to work while wearing those gloves.",15312.37,15322.15
"That's not big day pass for this, Luca.",15364.61502,15366.875
Yeah.,15369.73502,15370.23502
Hi.,15386.225,15386.56
"It's two hours and forty five minutes since the spacewalkers switched their suits to internal battery power, marking the beginning of the spacewalk.",15393.36,15401.165
"Since then, we've seen them work the power cable connecting it to the cables brought out on this spacewalk, and that will eventually power the off of magnetic spectrometer.",15401.625,15410.64
They also completed installing the mechanical attachment device that will hold the upgraded thermal tracker pump system.,15413.595,15419.535
But the real surgery of these spacewalks comes next when Parmatona will cut the current tube in which carbon dioxide is flowing to cool the alpha magnetic spectrometer.,15420.69,15430.225
And this will vent any c o two that is in the tube and also permanently disable the current cooling system on AMS.,15430.525,15438.04
"Following that, he will move to the vertical support beam area where he will even more carefully cut six of the eight stainless steel tubes we'll see cut today.",15442.1,15451.225
Those will be connected to the cooling system on the next spacewalk.,15451.605,15454.665
We'll see the astronauts really take their time as they move into these tasks to make sure they're cutting the correct tubes and doing everything properly to make it easier for the next spacewalk.,15457.53,15466.595
Alright.,15477.01,15477.33002
"Luca, we're ready the next JOCast, this will be one point five minutes.",15477.33002,15480.515

"We will see the the GCA, and it's that published position that we figured out last week.",15570.49,15575.95
"Actually, before that position, we're gonna do one manual position and then a single joint maneuver.",15577.28503,15581.84503
And then we will be able to snapshot and get you back to that other position.,15581.84503,15584.805

Right.,16736.885,16737.045
You just took it in the line.,16737.045,16738.505
"And do you, do you see any visual indications or any debris that anything sneak out of the MLI?",16738.885,16745.385
I don't see any debris.,16748.39996,16749.86
Okay.,16751.44,16751.94
Take another glove and half check from both of you here.,16752.39996,16754.975
Whelp is on my glove.,16759.375,16760.915
That's right and gray ass.,16761.77496,16763.875
Is dry in those offices.,16764.63,16765.93
Okay.,16767.43,16767.93
"Going forward today, we're back in this area where we've some sharp edges we need to watch out for, obviously, the cut tube ends and then the nut plates on the IPA and the VSP, the back sides.",16769.43,16780.19495
We talked about them last EVA.,16780.19495,16781.89496
K.,16786.9,16787.14
Next thing is the two polar to Luca.,16787.14,16789.4
Okay.,16791.815,16792.315
"And with that, Parmatino has cut the current cooling tube, permanently to say",16793.915,16800.0
Pulling the cooling system on the old tracker thermal control system on the alpha magnetic spectrometer.,16800.0,16805.38
The astronauts now moving into very detailed and specific procedures as they move to cut six of the eight tubes we'll see cut today.,16813.495,16821.89
These are housed in the vertical support beam.,16822.11,16824.455
"We saw the cover for the VSB removed on the previous spacewalk and jettisoned into space, putting the astronauts in configuration for the work to be done today.",16824.755,16834.04
That caps are available.,16835.38,16836.68
"So, Luca, once we get through this dwell time, hopefully, we'll we'll get verification prior to ten minutes, then we'll be going in there to identify the tubes So you're gonna open up the AMOI, protect the ribbon cable.",16841.195,16855.760002
"And then, we'll be going to the nadir side, nadir tube seven Okay.",16856.46,16863.274998
And Yep.,16892.46,16896.465004
"The European Organization for Nuclear Research or CERN, giving the indication that, yes, indeed, pressure has begun to drop in that tune line.",16896.465004,16906.17
"So show me, right hand comfortable position where you could, put a hand up work down after that.",16907.03,16915.455
Think of that.,16915.995,16916.975
That's good.,16917.835,16918.575
Yep.,16920.555,16921.055
I think this will be better.,16921.670006,16923.19
Okay.,16923.19,16923.69
Okay.,16929.285,16929.785
Yeah.,16929.845,16930.345
"And, Drew, get a glove glove and half check from you.",16933.605,16936.665
"Sorry, Drew.",16941.45,16941.93001
"I missed, yours somehow.",16941.93001,16943.23
Matt checks are free.,16947.765,16955.955
It's done a check.,16962.31,16963.37
"This time is good, Jimmy.",16980.635,16982.175
"So they were saying we we need at least another three minutes until we're gonna know And, at most, we're gonna be waiting another five and a half minutes.",16983.435,16991.7
"Reminder that, it's eighteen inches that you need to maintain.",16992.16,16996.18
So if you can reach the Venus side.,16996.32,16999.225
You're welcome to do that.,16999.225,17000.845
You start start retrieving the Yeah.,17005.91,17011.43
"So long as you can stay away from the nadir side by eighteen inches, you're welcome to open up the MLI.",17011.43,17018.515
Okay.,17020.575,17021.075
Parmatino is opening up the multilayer insulation and giving us a look at the tubes he will be cutting today.,17028.695,17034.395
He'll cut six in this area and then move to the nadir side or the earth facing side of the alpha magnetic spectrometer and cut another two.,17034.615,17043.095
These will later be connected to the upgraded thermal tracking pump system on spacewalk three.,17043.41501,17049.575
Done.,17049.735,17050.215
"Once we were concerned about, And the next one is another area of significant focus for us.",17050.215,17055.14
"We got a good plan, and we got the time to do this right once.",17055.36,17058.32
So that's what we'll do.,17058.32,17059.7
Yeah.,17064.515,17064.915
Definitely.,17064.915,17065.315
We'll do it right.,17065.315,17066.11502
There won't be one.,17066.11502,17067.255
"Drew, looking ahead, vice grips, or the next thing we're gonna need after caps Copy vice grips and, back to Affirm.",17083.945,17096.97998
"The area is, opens up Since none of these spacewalks were ever planned, because there was no expectation for the AMS to have more than a three year lifetime, None of the tubes the astronauts are cutting today were labeled.",17101.36502,17124.87
"However, teams on the ground have developed a way to label them to ensure the astronauts cut the right lines in the right places.",17125.09,17131.785
"The crew members will use cutting guides, which you can see in Parmitano's right hand.",17142.22998,17146.41
"At least, so we'll have any thoughts.",17146.965,17149.065
Parmatino will place that tube cutting guide over the tubes.,17158.42,17161.96
The green numbers show him which tubes to cut.,17162.1,17164.755
"Red are not to be cut and black will be cut, but in a different area.",17164.755,17168.615
He will then use the tube puller to do exactly that.,17170.73,17173.93002
Pull the tubes away from one another to cut them.,17173.93002,17176.51
And then he'll carefully cut the six stainless steel tubes in this area.,17176.65002,17180.535
He'll install caps on the upper tubes to cover sharp edges and help identify them later before eventually moving to the next three tubes to cut and cap.,17183.475,17192.12003
"Once that's completed in this area, they'll move over to the backside of the alpha magnetic spectrometer and do the same thing with the next two tubes.",17195.22,17203.005
K.,17204.665,17204.825
"We still haven't heard yet, Luca.",17204.825,17206.185
We're waiting another two minutes extraordinary patients required.,17206.185,17209.69998
Okay.,17212.0,17212.5
For Jeremy.,17251.595,17252.415
I've done anything else better today than this.,17252.555,17255.215
Yeah.,17257.275,17257.595
No doubt.,17257.595,17258.335
"Oh, we got well, we got a moment to kill.",17258.72,17260.72
"If you're enjoying the use of your tools, it's not EV two's birthday today, but it is a Drew's birthday.",17260.88,17265.52002
Drew Hood's birthday is today.,17265.52002,17267.14
Which one?,17270.275,17271.095
Drew Hood from the team.,17272.195,17273.805
"Oh, Oh, a very happy birthday then.",17273.805,17280.06
We'll be using these tools very soon.,17280.76,17283.5
Happy birthday to another Drew.,17293.69,17295.55002
I'm sure he's smiling.,17299.29,17300.51
Hey.,17315.58997,17315.75
What's the status?,17315.75,17316.73
K.,17321.70496,17322.105
"Drew or Luca, the the, ten minutes has passed.",17322.105,17326.265
We're just getting final go here.,17326.265,17327.97
Teams on the ground waiting to hear from the AMS team that the tubes are the c o two is fully vented from the station before moving on to cutting six of the eight tubes we'll see cut today here in this location.,17356.35504,17368.94995
"We still got pressure in the system, so we may have to pause before we actually do the rough cut.",17370.745,17375.545
But we'll start moving ahead and get ready for it.,17375.545,17377.705
So we're identifying nadir upper tube seven.,17377.705,17381.31
Go ahead.,17381.61005,17382.35004
Okay.,17383.37,17383.87
I have the nadir upper tube guide onto the tubes.,17384.97003,17390.075
The the arrow is pointing to the matching case.,17391.255,17394.235
"Number seven, is the second from much in case it's",17394.615,17400.0
"Green, and it's the first half from the middle for the vacuum case.",17400.0,17408.08
Alright.,17408.08,17408.48
Those are good words?,17408.48,17409.475
And I see the native guide on the native side.,17413.315001,17415.655001
Okay.,17416.435001,17416.935001
"And when I stole it like this, Right there.",17417.475,17424.56
"Before the two days happened, I did five again.",17442.809998,17445.585003
A major upper.,17450.285,17451.505
"Again, this the second from the matching case.",17454.31,17458.170002
First was about in case from the middle.,17459.43,17462.155
Okay.,17463.094997,17463.594997
"Good words, Luca.",17463.894997,17465.034996
You can pull that tube.,17465.975,17467.354996
So Parmatino identifying and pulling away the first tube that will be cut.,17469.494995,17477.71
Okay.,17483.885,17484.285
Removing the guide because it's the the steering or with the cutting.,17484.525,17488.689995
And then I've done it.,17489.149994,17490.53
You are ready for the rough color.,17491.31,17493.09
Copy.,17493.335,17493.835
Okay.,17498.615,17499.015
And we're gonna just pause here.,17499.015,17500.795
"We're gonna pause here for a second, Luca.",17501.04,17503.12
So do whatever you need to do to make sure we stay identified on the correct tube.,17503.12,17508.340004
K.,17510.494995,17510.814995
I have the tube that I have empty five and full in my side.,17510.814995,17515.954994
It's the second for the vacuum case.,17516.46,17518.64
"I confirm, and it's the one up.",17520.14,17523.42
"Once towards the vacuum case from the middle, also four from the from the bottom.",17523.42,17529.69499
And I can see by looking at the spacer as well that that is the one that is that you have pulled Okay.,17530.955,17537.45999
Good words.,17537.92,17538.64
We're not cutting yet just because we still have pressure in the system.,17538.64,17541.92
"It is decreasing, but we're just giving it a little bit more time.",17541.92,17545.175
Copy.,17547.015,17547.515
"Because there's still c o two, In the system, astronauts will be holding on making their first rough cut, but the first tube has been identified.",17552.215,17560.01
And you can see Luca has lifted it out.,17560.39,17562.79
Luca Palmitano has lifted from amongst the other tubes to identify which one will be cut first.,17562.79,17568.795
"After these tubes are rough cut today and capped, Parmitano and Morgan will venture out on the next spacewalk to smooth cut the same tools and eventually swage them or splice them to connect the new flex line to the existing alpha magnetic spectrometer line.",17622.595,17638.68001
Do you pull Luca right on?,17646.955,17648.97499
"K, Luca, Andrew.",17717.93,17718.72998
I wanna give you the big picture here.,17718.72998,17720.56998
"We are depressing, but a lot slower than we anticipated.",17720.96997,17723.94998
"And So at this stage, we still believe we have liquid that's boiling off.",17724.49,17728.82498
"So we're thinking about making a second cut to try and speed it up But at the current rate, we're thinking it might be twenty minutes before we get the pressure down.",17729.285,17736.61002
"So give us a second here, and then, we may do a second cut.",17736.61002,17740.39
Copy.,17744.285,17744.785
Copy.,17745.965,17746.285
Standing by.,17746.285,17747.185
"Okay, Luca.",17766.46,17767.25998
So we're gonna dig into the MLI where we just did the rough cut.,17767.25998,17770.63998
"And then, we're gonna grab on to it with the vice grips Sorry, where we just did the depress cut.",17770.69998,17776.125
"And then we'll, we'll probably end up getting the vice grips in there and doing a second cut.",17776.26498,17780.745
So the next step is opening MLI.,17780.745,17782.685
So dino cutters are lancer to Luca.,17783.29,17785.71
Sorry.,17792.045,17792.365
It's a second document to a second location.,17792.365,17794.945
"It'll be in the same location, them.",17796.92502,17799.15
"I'm still getting clear on where that second cut is gonna be, and then I'll give it to you.",17802.09,17806.66998
"We'll just start clearing her out and watch your arm over the, ret for the cutter.",17808.715,17813.61502
And I'll get you cutting implements.,17817.23,17819.23
"What would be, your favorite?",17819.23,17821.41
"Hi, miss Kevin.",17822.83002,17823.81003

Okay.,17874.86502,17875.345
"Stand by, Luca.",17875.345,17876.325
"So we're, we're talking about a few different options here, but I think the latest option they're talking to right now does not need we don't need to open that MLI.",17876.545,17885.66
So give me another minute here.,17885.72,17887.74503
Okay.,17889.80502,17890.30502
Teams on the ground are working to find another way to more rapidly vent the CO2 that's currently flowing through AMS.,17894.45,17902.385
"It is venting just a little bit slower than expected, and they want to hold off on cutting any additional tubes until that c o two is fully vented from the system.",17902.625,17911.445
"Comes out of the tray and goes into the same place that you just made the, the depress cut.",17911.74,17917.76
It comes out if I under stand correctly at a ninety degree angle.,17918.45996,17922.315
It is wrapped in MLI.,17924.775,17926.155
It's right here.,17929.65,17930.79
I can give you the cue with the the w v s Right here.,17932.85,17936.865
Yep.,17938.045,17938.525
"That's the right one, Luca.",17938.525,17940.065
So how do you feel about cutting that one with remove an MLI.,17941.885,17944.68994
Are you good with that?,17944.68994,17945.82996
"I can do it, but, I just want to be one hundred percent sure.",17947.73,17955.465
"I mean, number one, am I not switching into it?",17955.465,17960.205
Yeah.,17963.74,17964.06
"You will be, Luca, but not on this side.",17964.06,17966.06
This is the dead side.,17966.06,17967.01996
We'd be swaging into the other side of it.,17967.01996,17969.27997
Okay.,17971.18,17971.68
"And, I'm happy to cut give it that view then?",17973.365,17980.7
That that you have with?,17981.08,17982.30005
Yeah.,17982.92004,17983.24005
Put the rough cutters on it.,17983.24005,17984.52
I'm gonna ask the ground team one more time before you snippet.,17984.52,17987.5
"You know, how do you position Okay.",17993.205,17997.735
Alright.,18000.56,18001.06
"That's it, Luca.",18001.12,18002.1
Alright.,18002.3999999,18002.8999999
"And cutting another tube to continue venting that c o two, which you actually saw just a little bit coming out of the alpha magnet spectrometer's cooling system.",18017.36,18026.34
We think we're getting closer.,18026.835,18028.294998
K.,18028.835,18029.335
Three and a half hours into today's spacewalk.,18056.5,18059.0
Next task for the astronauts once this CO two level has dropped from the current cooling system will be to cut six tubes in the vertical support beam area.,18059.699997,18069.315
We're not gonna have to cut MLI or the vice grips just yet.,18070.13,18074.149994
Although vice grips are coming soon anyway.,18074.53,18076.549995
Seventy five.,18080.545,18081.924995
Okay.,18123.700005,18124.020004

"Hey, Luke.",18158.37,18158.93
"I'm curious about, that sharp edge we just created where we cut that tube.",18158.93,18162.69
What are your thoughts on it?,18162.69,18164.15
Sorry.,18169.24501,18169.725
No issues.,18169.725,18170.205

"One of our good heads today was to investigate the routing or the routing for, two and four, tubes two and four down to the NATO work site in in behind the TTCB.",18259.75998,18271.175
"So if you wanted to throw your camera back in there and, and just investigate how hard it's gonna be to route those tubes down there.",18271.715,18279.72
"It's gonna be very because I can see the nadir sight in tubes from here, and Drew will be able to, to dock them pretty easily.",18280.09998,18290.845
So I'm gonna stick you wanna stick my gopro down there?,18290.905,18294.28

"It's black, and it's one away from the matching case from that one.",19649.175,19654.555
And it's also on that last one on the DSP.,19656.11,19660.69
Now it's towards the matching case.,19661.94998,19663.87
It's the net one.,19663.87,19665.155
"Hey, Luca.",19672.31,19672.87

Okay.,19973.335,19973.655
"Do I need to turn on my to, turn on my the the the video?",19973.655,19980.96
Or is it the system?,19981.02,19982.16
It's space to space to grounds.,19982.3,19984.08
Copy.,19988.015,19988.515
Here's our cap eight.,19989.455,19990.735

"First, I need the roscoeado.",19991.375,19992.675
Yeah.,19994.895,19995.395
Parmatono identifying for teams on the ground the final tube in this area that will need to be cut.,20003.93501,20009.315
Middle one to the zero side.,20011.1,20013.84001
"Luca, that is correct.",20021.40501,20022.285
You are good to cut that tube.,20022.285,20023.985
Okay.,20033.45,20033.93001
"So keep the rough cutters there, Luca.",20033.93001,20035.87
"And, you can do your cleanup now, push any remaining cut tube ends into the VSB.",20036.375,20042.31499
We're thinking for close-up photos.,20043.70999,20045.56999
Maybe GoPro is best in this case given the lighting.,20045.62999,20048.61
I'll leave that up to you.,20048.67,20050.04999
"Drew, I'll take a glove and half check from you.",20050.51,20052.93
"Charlie, before we do any of that, I'm going to need to cover this is short.",20056.735,20060.93
Do I have?,20060.93,20061.75
"I could close this short, delete a cap.",20061.97,20063.81
Yeah.,20063.81,20064.13

K.,20085.165,20085.405
The copy's in.,20085.405,20086.605
The shot is contained.,20086.605,20087.905
"Did you want the rough cutter back for any, push pushing down anything?",20095.81,20100.31
"Oh, I see I think they're all three big bits of shape already.",20101.09,20105.595
"Okay, Luca.",20107.975,20108.875
We're gonna hand over here.,20109.77,20110.88998
I'll be back in about a minute.,20110.88998,20112.59
You can go ahead and clean that up and take some photos.,20112.88998,20115.37
Be back in thirty seconds.,20115.37,20117.47
And we will do some video as well.,20121.98502,20124.085
And Parmatino has cut and capped six tubes in the vertical support beam area.,20125.40997,20130.87
Only two more tubes to cut on the other side of the AMS.,20133.56497,20137.985
"But so far, in the past four hours of today's spacewalk, The astronauts have accomplished several tasks.",20138.76498,20144.13998
"First off, preparing a power cable that will later provide power from the station to the alpha magnetic spectrometer.",20144.13998,20150.48
"They then installed the mechanical attachment device or Mad, which will eventually hold the upgraded thermal tracker pump system.",20151.79498,20158.535
Also to be installed on the next spacewalk.,20158.73,20161.15002
We recently saw the astronauts cut the current tube which carbon dioxide was flowing through to cool the alpha magnetic spectrometer.,20163.85,20171.125
That permanently disabled the cooling system invented any existing c o two from the stomach.,20171.745,20177.28
That's dry.,20177.58,20178.4
My gloves are unchanged.,20178.7,20180.24
Yes.,20182.06,20182.56
I have no doctors on my gloves as well.,20182.94,20185.6
And might have these definitely dry.,20186.425,20188.765
Okay.,20191.305,20191.805
Good words.,20192.105,20192.845
"Next, we're gonna be putting the long wire ties in.",20193.65,20196.21
I wasn't sure.,20196.21,20196.85
Did you get the any close-up photos yet?,20196.85,20199.19
Photos.,20201.435,20201.915
Do you want video as well?,20201.915,20203.435
I haven't taken the video yet.,20203.435,20204.79498
There's no pro go go for it.,20204.79498,20206.475
Do a nice scan around.,20206.475,20208.01498
Cash.,20208.07498,20208.57498
Yeah.,20209.34,20209.66
That sounds good.,20209.66,20210.46
Folks would be quite interested to see the cutting in there.,20210.46,20213.02
"So if we get a good GoPro scan, that'll help out.",20213.02,20215.84
Ashronauts will revisit this worksite in the next spacewalk where they will use a smooth cutter to cut these same tubes and then they will swage them or splice them to the new upgraded tracker thermal pump system.,20218.605,20231.56
"Okay, Luca.",20238.175,20238.995
Long wire ties.,20239.055,20240.195
Three of them.,20240.255,20241.235
"Drew, you can clean up the tube cutting guides if you have access.",20248.21002,20251.59003
And then we're gonna need the zip tie cutter once we we get on to the next steps.,20251.73,20257.105
"A zip tie cutter is, based on me.",20259.005,20263.665
A ret on the diagonal beam handrail.,20264.27,20266.45
Any reason that it needs to hang out any longer?,20266.67,20269.17
I didn't think so from what I recall.,20271.20502,20273.385
"Negative, Drew.",20276.325,20277.36502
You can put it away.,20277.36502,20278.39
"The next bag we're gonna get into is crew lock bag three for an inventory, when time permits.",20287.165,20293.585
Copy.,20295.79,20296.29
Next task for the astronauts is to close out this worksite and ensure everything is thermally protected and in a good configuration for the third Spacewalk currently scheduled for December second.,20304.095,20314.26
"In just a moment, we'll see Parmatino use the zip tie cutter once again.",20333.01996,20337.27997
"To cut the lacing cord on the scrunchies, which are right below the caps that have been installed on the tubes.",20337.305,20343.245
Yeah.,20347.46,20347.7
"As long as you got the zip tie cutter accessible, we can get into that inventory.",20347.7,20351.96
That cutter is accessible.,20354.10004,20355.32
Right.,20357.765,20358.265
Black back three.,20358.485,20359.625
The exterior is at a large small.,20363.285,20365.39996
A small small.,20365.94,20367.16
"On the inside, we've got how I have the cutting guides on an integral ret with the adjustable between them, and I also have that ret that was originally on the mat.",20372.985,20385.68005
Now connect to that adjustable.,20385.68005,20387.755
So it's it's gonna stay here and cool our factory.,20388.055,20390.615
So it's got an extra to a non integral also to look at the the topics.,20390.615,20396.465
Yeah.,20396.525,20397.025
Yeah.,20399.565,20399.80505

First.,20400.0,20400.5
And I keep cat keeper has one to the more adjustables on it.,20403.12,20412.775
"Including one that has, another ret between cap keeper the adjustable, and it has the two remaining caps, two and four amount adjustable.",20414.28,20427.595001
And then we have a complete cap keeper on an interval rep.,20429.255001,20433.149998
Okay.,20435.37,20435.77
"It's good inventory, Drew.",20435.77,20437.21
"And, obviously, we need to be ready to have access to those final two caps today if we need them.",20437.21,20443.215
"Big picture, Luca.",20449.13,20450.350002
"And Drew, we're, four hours and ten minutes in.",20450.41,20454.350002
"We definitely move through the, the rough cut, at a at a good pace.",20454.89,20460.175
So we're on time line to get everything accomplished today.,20460.175,20462.735
We're just gonna have to keep moving efficiently.,20462.735,20464.675
That's right.,20466.89,20467.630005
Can I do that?,20468.01,20469.07
"Jay, since you're talking about time line, confirm that you have to spread to the top of it.",20502.61,20508.505
Sorry.,20513.305,20513.704994
Look at that.,20513.704994,20514.024994
It was unreadable.,20514.024994,20514.825
Say again?,20514.825,20515.52
The confirmation may be included in being currently deleted only by the battery.,20518.56,20523.939995
"That's correct, Luca.",20530.345,20531.565
Thank you.,20540.015,20544.995
"Loosely left the the Wi Fi, and then I will get them really tight when straight, but I'm ready for, affirm.",20549.31,20558.715
To close-up this window.,20559.015,20560.375
"So now you need the zip tie cutter, and we'll start working that We probably want access to the tube polar to help get the scrunchies in and, potentially the tape if you're gonna use that.",20560.375,20574.4
Yeah.,20578.94499,20579.105
I'll put it on the transfer.,20579.105,20580.22499
Right?,20580.22499,20580.305
"You should be able to use this, sir?",20580.305,20582.08499
Yes.,20582.385,20582.885
Okay.,20585.37001,20585.77

Do you want if you need a two cooler already?,20586.89,20589.29001
You want two cooler.,20589.29001,20590.35
Let's start on the zenith side.,20593.225,20595.16501
You pull this to you.,20617.92001,20619.3
Parmatino is currently using the zip tie cutter to cut the lacing cord on what are called scrunchies.,20631.195,20636.87999
"These scrunchies will be pushed down into the vertical support beam area in order to protect the tubes thoroughly, so they aren't over exposed because these will be the same tubes that will be connected to the new upgraded tracker thermal pump system on the next spacewalk.",20637.5,20652.19499
"So, Luca, I know you're probably already thinking this, but I I just wanna remind you this is where you don't wanna put any bends in the tube for the next EVA This clutches are not I think that one doesn't look like it expanded.",20674.025,20698.73502
It did not So Luca did one side not let go.,20699.355,20719.25
"If you, maybe just grab the other side with a two polar and give it a yank, it might might free it up.",20720.35,20726.355
Yeah.,20744.535,20744.61502
"It looks like you're doing the right thing there, Luca.",20744.61502,20746.875
I guess.,20759.36,20760.02
Yeah.,20764.125,20764.44498
Let's hope the other ones work a little easier for you.,20764.44498,20767.345
Sure.,20798.225,20798.725
Yep.,20799.105,20799.605
I need it.,20800.065,20800.625
I'm Good.,20800.625,20801.47
Roger.,20805.05002,20805.55002
Sorry.,20815.305,20815.805
"Me remind me, you only want me to cut black side confirm.",20870.21002,20874.95
"Since it even released, can I cut that completely cut the lacing?",20877.73,20881.815
"So you just need to cut the black on both sides, and I'll check here.",20883.155,20886.595
But I understood that you can Cutting more is also okay.,20886.595,20889.75
So let me double check.,20889.75,20890.97
So the only thing you don't wanna cut is those loops that you used last time to expand it.,20900.155,20905.05502
Alright.,20932.29504,20932.79504
"Good work, Luca.",20933.49506,20934.47504
Tedious task.,20934.775,20935.99506
Only four more to go.,20940.95,20942.41
"As Parmitano works to cut these, scrunchie cords and move them down into what's being called the burrito of multi layer insulation at the base of the tubes.",20951.435,20961.55
We have a question from Isaac.,20962.25,20964.11
He wants to know if the stainless steel tubes will be welded back together after they were cut today.,20965.635,20971.335
"These tubes won't be welded back together, but it's not the last time we will see them.",20972.96,20977.06
"On the next spacewalk, Parmitano and Morgan will revisit this work site, to smooth cut the tool and then swage them together, which is connecting them to the new flex line, which is part of the existing alpha magnetic spectrometer line.",20977.12,20991.96
Almost four hours and twenty minutes into today's spacewalk.,21025.485,21028.625

Yes.,21035.21,21035.71
Yes.,21036.25,21036.75
"Now it's probably a good time to just re cage our brains, the The primary purpose here is to make sure we have no tube to tube contact.",21038.969997,21046.565
Yep.,21052.47,21052.71
We and I can see.,21052.71,21053.83

Okay.,21133.8,21134.3
"Luka, what you're doing is looking good.",21140.945,21142.865
We're not looking for perfection here as long as those main priorities of tube to tube contact are taken care of we're in good shape.,21142.865,21149.8
"After Palmitano completes the tasks at this work site and ensures none of the tubes are touching each other, Jessica Meyer will move him again using the Canada arm too all the way to the next work site, which is just the other side of the alpha magnetic spectrometer.",21162.325,21176.57
They'll continue cutting the tubes there finishing off the last two to be cut today.,21178.29501,21182.955

Parmatonna will now move over and complete the next couple.,21411.42502,21414.80502
To finish out this worksite.,21415.03998,21416.5
"Drew, I'm curious how you'd feel about doing the closeout photos, well, Luca was on his way to the nadir work site.",21451.63,21456.99
Would that work?,21456.99,21457.81
Yes.,21460.43,21460.93
Okay.,21463.505,21463.905
Let's plan on it.,21463.905,21465.125
"The next things that you'll be staging, Drew, not right now, because you're helping Luca.",21465.98502,21470.26
There's a small ORU bag and a tube clip.,21470.26,21472.68
"Or are you back, just so that I could hand it off to Luca at the next site.",21475.97498,21479.175
Is that right?,21479.175,21479.995
That's it.,21481.655,21482.47498

"And, Luca and Drew, for both of you, just remember that extra cut on that tube, one just while you're working around that area.",21556.06,21562.415
"Luca, for you right now.",21562.795,21563.915
"And, Drew, when you do go in there for the close-up photos.",21563.915,21566.575
Okay.,21568.395,21568.895
K.,21570.3,21570.38
Do you have a go to just push it into itself?,21570.38,21573.36
"Like that way, Still me from the shop that way.",21574.77997,21580.525
I believe you.,21580.585,21581.565
I I view the shunt.,21586.32,21587.78
Just pulling it away.,21588.0,21589.30005
"Okay, Luca.",21593.265,21593.985

That'll be it.,21711.765,21712.825
"For, you tie that one down, Luca.",21714.325,21717.74
I think you could use the two cooler to push on cap five sleeve a little bit more if you could get down a couple more inches for sure.,21718.28,21728.815
There we go.,21728.815,21729.455
Yeah.,21729.455,21729.955
And the thing that's preventing it is that top lip of the MLI.,21730.175,21733.395
"I know If you pull on that top lip of MOI, it's gonna back it out for a second, but I think we're in the end, we're gonna get that push down there a little further like you have.",21733.455,21743.54999
Okay.,21745.67499,21746.17499
We're real happy with the way that burrito works.,21749.435,21751.83499

Yeah.,21779.845,21780.085
You can take those.,21780.085,21781.225
And the first thing he's gonna use when he gets there is the lancer.,21781.285,21784.15
Probably better for you to just hand it to him at the work site.,21784.15,21786.89
Alright.,21789.82999,21790.32999
"Is the last view, with my GPS?",21792.99501,21797.49501

I'm gonna start motioning this Jocast in two point five minutes.,22441.7,22444.84
It'll be two both of the time is Jokas.,22445.675,22447.615
"It will be one point five minutes only, actually.",22454.19,22456.53
Okay.,22503.15,22503.65
"Okay, Luca.",22528.175,22528.815
That's position hold here.,22528.815,22529.935
We're going to load the next drug test.,22529.935,22531.79498
Hi.,22552.945,22553.25
"Luca, this next show cast will be two minutes in course.",22579.24503,22581.725
Ready for motion?,22581.725,22582.625
Three questions.,22584.25,22584.91
Four hours and forty six minutes into today's space walk.,22638.72998,22642.35
You can see astronaut Luca Parmatano on the end of the Canada arm two being moved into place by NASA astronaut Jessica Mir.,22642.465,22649.685
"To give you some perspective on the size of the International Space Station, from end to end, it's about the same size as a football field, including the end zones.",22651.06998,22659.72998
"Although Palmitano wasn't going a very far distance, it takes extremely precise robotic work for the Canada arm two move him to exactly where he needs to be on the alpha magnetic spectrometer.",22671.99,22682.725
"And just for your essay, we're handing over here in twenty second We'll be back in a minute.",22685.26498,22689.56
"We've got another ask and ask a question coming from James, who wants to know if Luca is working on the same thing as the last Spacewalk, his students notice that it looks pretty similar.",22708.96002,22718.47504
"And the answer is, in a way, yes, all of these spacewalks, this series of four, are to repair the alpha magnetic spectrometer, which has been on the station for the last eight and a half years and collected data on over one hundred forty billion cosmic ray events, keying us into things like anti matter and dark matter in space.",22718.775,22739.075
"So far today, the astronauts have prepared a power cable that will route power from the station to the alpha magnetic spectrometer and attach the device that will hold the upgraded thermal tracker pump system.",22740.495,22750.94
Which will be used to cool the alpha magnet spectrometer.,22751.045,22754.185
"They've just cut the current tube, that was flowing using carbon dioxide to cool the AMS as well as cut six other stainless steel tubes that will eventually be connected to the upgraded thermal system.",22755.52496,22768.895
"So, yes, in a way, this is the same kind of work that was performed on the first space walk in the same area.",22773.11505,22778.70996
"On the first space walk, we saw the astronauts jettison a Debris Shield, as well as the vertical support beam cover that was on top of the worksite, Parmitano, and Morgan have just departed.",22778.93,22790.64496
"So, Drew, just to make sure we're on the same page.",22846.805,22849.524998
You've got the tube clip ready.,22849.524998,22851.144997
And the smaller are you bag.,22851.66,22853.179996
Did you wanna stage that now or you wanna come back to that later?,22853.5,22856.48
I get smaller.,22857.659996,22858.46
Are you back to stage?,22858.46,22859.6
"I have all the tools, stage.",22859.659996,22861.12
Got the two clip staged.,22861.405,22863.344997
Okay.,22864.365,22864.865
"And, Lancer is one of those all the tools staged?",22864.924995,22868.065
No.,22869.965,22870.205
It So I have crew lock back two available.,22870.205,22872.619995
"It's all cutting implements available, and I have the two tube caps.",22872.619995,22876.54
"Everything is, reachable.",22876.54,22878.159996
Okay.,22879.314995,22879.814995
That sounds like we've pretty much got everything we can do done.,22880.034996,22883.715
"As we head into the lower worksite, the caution we gotta remind ourselves of, you know, the sensitive areas of AMS.",22883.715,22889.91
So avoiding loads into the UMA cables.,22889.91,22892.89
And contact with those cables in the forward side of the radiator crates.,22893.575,22897.595
You're gonna lean back.,22905.1,22906.06
Look at me.,22906.06,22906.96
I'm at your head lean back.,22907.02,22908.72
Communicating with astronauts from the ground today is Canadian Space Agency astronaut Jeremy Hansen who has also trained extensively on these off of magnetic spectrometer spacewalks.,22919.38,22929.565
"He just reminded the crew that they'll be working in a very sensitive area for the next tasks to cut the next two tubes, and they'll also revisit this work site in the next space so they're going to take their time and understand the robotics it takes to get them to this area as well as better understand the worksite itself.",22931.44,22948.32501
"One of you in the Tarjandra, Earthland, in the back?",22952.08,22954.73999
"Alright, Lisa.",22956.855,22957.495
That is position hold there.,22957.495,22958.855
We're gonna get set up for a manual maneuver.,22958.855,22960.955
Okay.,22961.33499,22961.83499
I can see my my side there.,22961.97499,22964.06

Okay.,22985.55,22985.95
Good.,22985.95,22986.45
Always keep in mind with the answer.,22990.58499,22992.44499
You can let me know when you're ready and I'll stop you hopping.,22997.01999,22999.68
Okay.,23002.78,23003.18
"Copy that, Luca.",23003.18,23004.22
We are ready.,23004.22,23005.2
"And Drew, you'll be assisting with clearances as always.",23005.26,23008.575
This is going to be two maneuvers.,23008.795,23010.41501
"First, I'm gonna bring you station nadir about thirty centimeters.",23010.63501,23013.935
Then I will bring you station forward a little over a meter.,23014.32,23017.38

It's Fresh Frank over here.,23571.81,23573.27
Right.,23578.655,23579.05501
I think I'll catch what comes off.,23579.05501,23583.535
Never mind if you go any left.,23583.535,23585.395
Yes.,23585.79001,23586.19
They are Yeah.,23586.19,23603.01
"Luca, that cable right there is one of the ones to be real careful not to bump it.",23603.01,23606.45
So I know you gotta work in that area.,23606.45,23607.97
I just wanna remind you.,23607.97,23609.35
Yeah.,23611.015,23611.175
I know.,23611.175,23611.495
"I know that the that is, I don't think I understand, but I need turned off at first and why it still work?",23611.495,23621.8
Doing good if that's already the vertical part of the heat done.,23658.97,23661.71002
How far up doing good?,23669.665,23671.125
Halfway up.,23673.41,23674.31
"So right there should be the Velcro patch where that kind of double, MLI thread is And then you'll have to cut that one because you got your right thumb on and then another Velcro patch above it.",23689.5,23708.8
Yeah.,23713.18,23713.66
You got it.,23713.66,23714.455
It's perfect.,23714.53497,23715.19498
"As Parmatano works in this area and receives reminders from the ground about the delicacy of this worksite, it's important to remember the difficulty of these spacewalks They were never really intended to happen as the alpha magnetic spectrometer at cosmic ray and particle detector was only expected to have a lifetime of three years.",23738.72,23757.875
"Eight and a half years later, it has detected over one hundred and forty billion cosmic ray events.",23758.31998,23763.46
And these spacewalks will help stand at the lifetime of the alpha magnetic spectrometer after the new cooling system is installed.,23763.84,23770.335
So maybe cut away from those if you can.,23774.37,23776.85
"That cable, Luca, overcome by events disregard.",23776.85,23781.59
"Good work, Luca.",23804.53,23805.51
"Just to be clear, everyone's real happy with what they see.",23805.65,23808.05
We're just talking out loud just in case it's helpful.,23808.05,23810.55
"So at this point, Luca, it's really just what you need to get the job done.",23871.0,23874.46
"So you've cut most of what we were expecting you to cut Alright, Drew.",23875.63998,23884.725
Ready for the chip for the clip.,23884.725,23886.505

You guys are still receiving data through the cable?,24236.7,24241.76
Okay.,24246.44499,24246.94499
"Short wire tie, around that tube clip.",24247.325,24250.065
"Actually, just a real question.",24254.83,24256.37
"Jeremy, do you what do you guys know if the cable go about the the It's still good.",24256.43,24262.755
"So far, we've got, good data in AMS we're we're keeping an eye on it.",24268.655,24273.46002
"Parmatino has just placed a tube clip, which he's going to secure with a wire tie, before moving on to cut the two cables you can see.",24285.325,24293.4
"Just like the previous tubes we saw cut earlier under the vertical support beam area, You'll also install tube caps to cover the sharp edges and later identify which tube is which.",24297.595,24308.03
At all?,24310.225,24310.96503
Almost almost none.,24313.02502,24314.70502
"I mean, like, maybe get five more centimeters.",24314.70502,24318.64502
"Drew, the next thing is the rough cutters.",24410.62,24412.48
Luca Pop quiz.,24417.95502,24418.915
I got a warning here.,24418.915,24419.875
What's the rule of thumb for the rough cutters?,24419.875,24421.815
Alright.,24429.78,24430.185
Again.,24430.585,24430.985

You're actually working.,24432.985,24433.865
I get it.,24433.945,24434.585
What's the rule of thumb for the rough cutter?,24434.585,24436.26498
Is something you can't put in there?,24436.26498,24437.885
Are you speakers?,24441.49,24442.47
Exactly.,24443.81,24444.31
You pass.,24444.85,24445.59
Alright.,24447.865,24448.185
"And then we're gonna monitor, clearance to cut tubes when we're installing the the caps.",24448.185,24452.685
We're gonna use the rough cutter to cut both tubes in four.,24452.745,24455.805
"Two four is the one with, multiple bends in it.",24457.12003,24460.58002
"Drew after rough cutters, we need the caps.",24464.47498,24466.815
Copy.,24469.91498,24470.235
Okay.,24470.235,24470.63498
Did you?,24470.63498,24471.29498
Look very much like they have moved before.,24472.65,24474.99
I think that this one here is two four.,24478.70502,24481.345
Yeah.,24481.345,24481.665
That's that would be my guess.,24481.665,24482.86502

Cut two four.,24523.5,24524.72003
Sure.,24529.125,24529.625
"Do you want me to cut them both and then give them or It's really up to you, Luca.",24530.165,24535.42
Right.,24535.42,24535.58
"But, typically, we did cut them both.",24535.58,24537.52
K.,24539.5,24539.89996
So I'm gonna cut them both.,24539.89996,24541.52
Thank you.,24543.185,24543.925
E as e as in latch.,24543.985,24545.685

Okay.,24576.685,24577.185
This is cap two here.,24578.045,24580.125
You can just let the tube puller go.,24580.125,24582.065
Here's cap two.,24582.125,24583.085
I have cap two and and four is gonna be attached to this adjustable since you're gonna need it shortly.,24583.085,24589.12

Of course.,24613.025001,24613.6050005
Those are the last two rough cuts he'll make today.,24615.265,24617.925
And he's now placing the caps on top to protect he and NASA astronaut Andrew Morgan from sharp edges.,24618.2,24625.725
As well to identify those tubes.,24625.725,24627.825
A group of test from two.,24635.59,24637.29
Before.,24647.315002,24647.815002

Excellent work.,24651.075,24652.055
I have two good pull tests on two and four.,24655.03,24660.57
Okay.,24661.395,24661.895
We're happy with what we see.,24662.995,24664.674995
"So now, as you release those, we'll just tuck things back.",24664.674995,24669.255
Make sure the MLI is positioned to minimize mylar exposure.,24670.060005,24673.920006
"Yeah, Luca.",24691.06,24691.7

They're going back in crew lock bag three.,24713.475,24715.735
"And then we'll get, Luca.",24718.515,24720.375
We're gonna basically use a little bit of time we have left to do some robotics translation to investigate how we're gonna get to the MLI install position in the final EBA.,24720.435,24733.43501
Okay.,24749.405,24749.905
I think that wraps up things down there.,24749.925,24752.365
"So, Luca, the next thing we wanna do is move to your right, and over to where you're gonna have to wrap the MLI connection around the on the side.",24752.365,24766.735
So your thoughts on that?,24767.035,24768.735
Think I I did something here during the robo session.,24774.59,24777.41
"So I just if I was gonna do, basically, from this position, I'm just gonna lean back And, you have a go to maneuver one and a half meter to my right.",24777.47,24792.185
Okay.,24793.95999,24794.28
That's Luca.,24794.28,24794.92

We're gonna see it back into mode.,24798.36,24799.74
"By one before that motion, we before I we take, Luca away from me out of reach Do you think I should hand off the ORU bag?",24801.295,24810.42
Yeah.,24814.975,24815.21501
It seems like a reasonable idea to me.,24815.21501,24816.895
"Luca, are you ready for it?",24816.895,24818.43501
By a second.,24823.06999,24823.79

"I I pulled it, but doesn't look like it's folded as it could be.",24846.26,24849.905
"As the space station flies two hundred and fifty nine statute miles over Algeria, astronauts are closing out the last work site of the day, the nadir side of the alpha magnetic spectrometer.",24856.77002,24867.935
"Oh, well, thank you.",24868.91498,24872.50497
"Packing, or are you packing bags this settlement saying?",24875.95,24879.41
"Wheat, I think crew lock back three could be closed up.",24883.47,24886.505
"It's inventory, and we're just we're, down those two caps we just installed.",24886.505,24891.005
Yep.,24892.81,24893.13
We concur.,24893.13,24893.87

And then I I would like the team to bring both where they expect me to put the with a different Yeah.,25030.29,25047.01
"So, Luca, while you're taking those pictures, you know the struts on the other side of the radiator that we were we're talking about earlier today, the ones you You can you can touch the other ones, but not the middle one.",25047.01,25058.725
Yeah.,25059.265,25059.765

"From here, on the way back, I can do that.",25074.225,25077.205
No.,25078.3,25078.54

No.,25080.94,25081.18
No.,25081.18,25081.34
"I'm I'm just telling you that the exact same struts, but where you are, the opposite side of the radiator, that's what you need to reach.",25081.34,25088.115
Negative what?,25089.07498,25089.97498
From here?,25098.5,25099.32
Yeah.,25100.18,25100.68
That's it.,25100.82,25101.56
"So one of the right where that strap is right now, Luca, That's where you're gonna have to reach, and you're gonna put a strap around for the MLI.",25101.78,25109.275
And I'm handing over in ten seconds.,25109.895,25111.91498
Too.,25114.14,25114.64
Yeah.,25116.38,25116.62
"So take a good picture of that and, and then, I'll talk to you on the other side of this handover.",25116.62,25121.92004
Okay.,25124.405,25124.905
Hi.,25165.10504,25165.41

I'm starting to lean forward.,25196.745,25198.585
I'm cleaning up.,25198.585,25199.565
Awesome.,25200.08,25200.58
"Okay, Luca.",25201.36,25202.08

"I have two I have two friends with it, which I believe is still not actually being and I'm back at my hands on both of the on the straps.",25208.295,25218.65
So I'm pretty confident about that position.,25218.65,25220.83
Okay.,25221.45,25221.77
Perfect.,25221.77,25222.27
So that's one of them.,25222.555,25223.515001
And then the other thing maneuver to it.,25223.515001,25225.595001
"The other thing you need to do is once you, you wrap the connector around that strap, you tuck the back flap of the cover, which is more just in towards AMS.",25225.595001,25237.88
"So not on the side like you are right now, but back a little bit towards the middle and in straight towards AMS.",25237.88,25244.215
"There's another, I guess, it's a strut in there.",25244.675003,25248.535
That could be it.,25249.760002,25250.48
"I can't see it in your camera, but that's where it is.",25250.48,25253.22
Yeah.,25255.735,25255.975002
That looks about right.,25255.975002,25256.855
And then you you tuck the MLI in under there.,25256.855,25259.515
Yeah.,25261.415,25261.575
I think you're giving us good views.,25261.575,25263.175
So maybe take a picture of that area.,25263.175,25264.76
"And we'll be able to circle it for you, before the next DBA.",25264.920006,25268.46
Okay.,25285.1,25285.6
"Hey, Luca.",25288.299995,25288.939995
It's great.,25288.939995,25289.34
We're just checking if there's anything else we want you to investigate before you leave.,25289.34,25293.244995
Absolutely.,25297.784996,25298.284996
"Take your time, All the time that we have, let's use it.",25298.345,25302.56
This is the first time I see this item.,25303.5,25305.84
Alright.,25318.39,25318.89
"Last thing, Luca, would be getting eyes on the path where the The tubes two and four are gonna come down from the new pump box.",25319.27,25327.705
"You looked at it from the other side, but can you get eyes on or a picture of it from this side?",25327.705,25332.525
"And you talked to be easier to, take me back when I was.",25339.06,25343.44499
Yeah.,25344.305,25344.545
We may not need it.,25344.545,25345.745
You talked us through it before and said it was gonna be really easy for you.,25345.745,25349.265
And we think you took a picture at that time.,25349.58499,25351.58499
Was that correct?,25351.58499,25352.34
Two feature videos.,25356.26,25357.31

Forty centimeters left?,25369.03,25370.65
"Yes, ma'am.",25371.03,25371.85
No.,25375.595,25375.83499
I also had that.,25375.83499,25377.055
"When I leaned back and I looked at the Nator worksite, oh, Luca was in the VSP.",25377.355,25383.19499
I could see his light shining through a a bunch of places.,25383.19499,25386.62999
It it is it looks like a pretty open shot.,25387.41,25389.91
K.,25390.20999,25390.37
"And you're ready for that motion, Drew.",25390.37,25391.56999
You ready for clearances?,25391.56999,25392.515
Yes.,25392.515,25392.755
I'm ready for cleaning.,25392.755,25393.795
I have no Starting motion.,25393.795,25394.915
"I have no good hear you, miss Jessica.",25394.915,25396.455
K.,25397.075,25397.235
Starting motion.,25397.235,25398.055
"Now's astronaut, Jessica Meer, using the Canada arm two to move Luca Parmatano back into position to get some final photos of that work site.",25405.44,25414.075
"Hey, there it is.",25414.375,25415.515
Okay.,25419.61,25420.11
Give me a chance to go towards the DMV?,25435.39,25437.73
Yep.,25438.11,25438.61
See if you can identify that stuff?,25445.935,25448.675
"And, Luca, are we done the GCA?",25451.33,25453.11
"So we don't two people speak for the moment, but no base on.",25459.25,25463.435
K.,25463.73502,25464.055
Please stay complete.,25464.055,25465.035
"So, Luca, we we do have a few minutes here.",25465.975,25468.52
So all we wanted to do is give you an opportunity to understand that path from the the point of view that you're gonna see it from.,25468.52,25475.41998
Those two tubes coming down to you.,25475.56,25477.58
"And, you can take a picture of it if you like.",25478.065,25480.405
And then that's gonna wrap up our work at this work site.,25480.465,25483.445
Right.,25483.905,25484.30502
"Now what I that so I'd like to see here Drew at the DMV site and, you watch my, headlights.",25484.30502,25495.645
You could see.,25495.645,25496.125
"I mean, I can I can see you on the I can see you through here?",25496.125,25500.045
Okay.,25500.045,25500.285
"If you can speak to him, there.",25500.285,25504.12
Yeah.,25504.18002,25504.68002
It was there exactly.,25504.9,25506.2
Okay.,25509.22,25509.72
Alright.,25515.485,25515.885
Do you video cameras?,25515.885,25516.925
"So I mean, I don't I don't wanna look at it.",25516.925,25519.505
Looks pretty straightforward.,25522.35,25523.49002
Yeah.,25524.67,25525.07
We we could see Drew through your WVS as well.,25525.07,25528.35
So that looked good.,25528.35,25529.65002
It's the past right if we were going.,25534.495,25536.35498
"If you go around along the vacuum case, below the the DPC in between the DPC and then in the admin case.",25541.55002,25555.05502
Everything on my way.,25556.68,25558.06
Yeah.,25558.68,25559.08
"What you described sounds right to me, I'll just check with the team.",25559.08,25561.87997
"So between the vacuum case and the TTCV, is where those tubes are gonna go.",25561.87997,25566.845
Hey.,25568.785,25569.285
Yeah.,25571.225,25571.70502
I think Drew is great.,25571.70502,25573.165
Yeah.,25574.22998,25574.71
"And, I think it will be obvious.",25574.71,25579.28998
Okay.,25580.31,25580.78998
So it's not easy.,25580.78998,25582.00998
"There's nothing ever used, but probably Yeah.",25582.575,25585.455
"Well, we don't wanna give you an easy jobs.",25585.455,25587.555
Okay.,25588.095,25588.575
"That wraps it up, Luca.",25588.575,25589.955
Drew.,25589.98,25590.22
"Do you need anything from us, before we get, Luca on his way out of that work site?",25590.22,25594.72
"We'll just need some time to do some of our inventories, but I think we'll get them out of that at the GCA area.",25598.995,25605.895
Okay.,25606.66998,25606.99
We agree.,25606.99,25607.71
"Alright, Luca.",25607.71,25608.68997
"Take your cell phone and then, let us know when GCA action is complete.",25609.71,25613.96997
"Hey, Jessica.",25618.385,25619.20502
You can apply to the nearest published position What do I have to do at home?,25619.265,25625.03998
"Okay, Luca.",25626.53998,25627.25998
Standby one.,25627.25998,25628.24
As Luca Parmatano and Drew Morgan close out their work this last worksite for the day for the day.,25637.45502,25643.63
"They took some additional pictures, to remember the sensitive tubes that they should try to avoid as they make their way back here on the next scheduled alpha magnetic space walk.",25643.69,25654.915
They also took some time to understand the area and the robotics it took to get them there on the canid arm too.,25660.08,25666.435
Okay.,25685.72498,25686.125
Copy that.,25686.125,25686.94498
"Okay, Luca.",25690.09,25690.81
We've got slightly amended.,25690.81,25691.93
We're not gonna do just a reverse of how you got in there.,25691.93,25694.88998
We're gonna start out with a positive pitch.,25694.88998,25697.815
So we're gonna pitch you up.,25697.815,25699.595

"As Parmitano and Drew Morgan move away from this worksite, They are reaching almost five hours and forty minutes into today's spacewalk to bring you to your left.",25755.525,25766.89
Copy.,25767.11005,25767.61005
"The astronauts have completed all of their tasks for today, starting out by preparing the power cable that will eventually route power from the station the alpha magnetic spectrometer and installing the mechanical attachment device or Mad that will house the upgraded thermal tracker pump system which we will see installed on the spacewalk December second.",25769.505,25789.375
"Parmitano disabled the what was current cooling system, which was flowing carbon dioxide to the alpha magnetic",25792.155,25799.95496
Trometer by clipping a tube and venting any existing c o two in the system.,25800.0,25805.2999997
He then moved on to cut six stainless steel tubes in the vertical support beam area.,25805.7599998,25810.764999
Those will be connected to the cooling system on the next space walk.,25811.065,25814.445
"After closing out that worksite and making sure everything was thermally protect protected and in a good configuration, they moved to this work site on the nadir side of the alpha magnetic spectrometer.",25815.82,25826.435
"Harmitano removed the insulation and cut a cut an additional two tubes, then capped them to identify and protect from any sharp edges.",25829.215,25839.12
"So Today was an extremely challenging spacewalk, every movement being deliberate, and, worksites being very delicate as Spacewalkers prepare to repair the alpha magnetic spectrometer.",25865.51,25885.72
Okay.,25886.9,25887.380005
Starting motion is gonna be about one point four meters.,25887.380005,25890.035
"What makes these spacewalks most challenging is that they were never planned to be attempted because the alpha magnetic spectrometer or AMS was expected to have a three year lifetime However, it has been in operation for over eight and a half years now and collected data on over one hundred forty billion cosmic ray events.",25894.915,25913.765
"Because these spacewalks were not intended, specific tools have been developed on the ground, tools, and procedures over the last four years.",25922.465004,25930.725
That allowed the spacewalkers to complete the work they did today and what we hope to see on the next two spacewalks to repair the AMS.,25930.97,25939.15
"Hey, Luca.",25941.74501,25942.46501
Now we are going to bring you Station Venus.,25942.46501,25946.24501
Okay.,25948.12,25948.52
I should bring it from here.,25948.52,25950.04001
I got to clear.,25950.04001,25951.18001

Hey.,25967.44,25967.68
Look at stopping motion there.,25967.68,25968.97
Perfect.,25968.97,25969.47
Spacewalks like these in which Teams have had to develop new tools and specific processes help us prepare for future long duration missions when other difficult tasks crop up.,25972.815,25990.34
Like our journey to the moon with the artemis program.,25990.66501,25994.445
Okay.,25994.74501,25995.225
"We copy that, we're ending the GCA at this point.",25995.225,25998.21
"And, we're ready to start talking to Drew.",25998.29001,26000.21
"I'd get a glove and a half check half check from you though, Luca first.",26000.21,26003.43001
"Change using my gloves, no delta.",26009.705,26012.125
"And, Droidheart.",26014.265,26015.46
"K, Drew.",26019.04001,26019.76001
"Same from you, when you're ready.",26019.76001,26021.94
Hey.,26025.33499,26025.575
"Trying to dry half, and my gloves are, no deltas.",26025.575,26029.275
From the last report.,26029.55,26030.85
Okay.,26031.63,26032.13
"What do you wanna clean up first, Drew?",26032.19,26034.13
Alright.,26039.645,26040.145
"I'll I'll start with the red back, and, we'll talk about what's in it.",26040.525,26044.785
Staking in for a Jocast.,26045.165,26046.36499
"Luca, I'm gonna start motion.",26046.36499,26047.405
It's gonna be three point five Promotion.,26047.405,26049.17
Motion.,26050.23,26050.73
Go ahead.,26051.79,26052.27
"The red bag, Drew.",26052.27,26053.41
Okay.,26057.285,26057.785
I'm gonna read back exterior to large justicals.,26057.845,26061.705
Large small ret.,26063.205,26064.41
On the outside.,26065.85,26066.75
"And then on the inside, on the lid, there's now a small, small rep that for previously happy cliff because it's now, just an empty red on the lid and fish stringer.",26067.77,26077.885
"On the fishmonger, all I have is the tool board and, yeah, EVA inspection mirror a two board, an adjustable small, small, adjustable ret, and a small, small ret attached to it.",26078.90997,26099.55
"And then the tools Got it, soft cutter, deep straightener, the puller, main cutter, in the seven eights.",26100.00998,26110.61002
"The bags, remaining we used three pieces of tape today.",26110.61002,26117.80502
So we have at least fifteen remaining.,26117.80502,26119.44
Two three four five.,26119.44,26123.505
Okay.,26127.52,26128.02
Copy that.,26128.16,26128.96
We were Yeah.,26128.96,26129.68
Four in about fourteen ish.,26129.68,26131.69998
Okay.,26133.425,26133.925
"So fourteen piece of tape, we were expecting, the adjustable with a ret from the Mad, but I think that ended up somewhere on we'll find that.",26134.22498,26143.83002
It did.,26147.73,26148.37
I recall when bag.,26148.37,26150.185
I put it in a bag.,26150.185,26152.125
"And, Yep.",26153.38498,26154.50497
No worries.,26154.50497,26155.06497
"I called it at the time, but I don't recall which we put it in.",26155.06497,26158.44498
I think crew lock back too was the one we were working in as a storm.,26158.97,26162.01
So it probably ended up there.,26162.01,26163.29
Yeah.,26163.29,26163.79
Okay.,26166.06497,26166.38498
We'll find it through.,26166.38498,26167.50497
"The RET's in crew lock bag three, and we'll find the adjustable.",26167.50497,26170.38498
"So that's a good, inventory of the red bag.",26170.38498,26173.205
"Okay, Kat.",26177.19,26178.56998
"And then this goes on saying the large small red at some point, you're gonna put inside the lid before you tighten it up.",26191.44,26203.845
"I'm gonna close it up with, and leave just enough room to do that.",26208.81,26212.73
But we do one of the last things I do.,26212.73,26214.75
Is that tucked as inside?,26215.46503,26217.08502
Yep.,26217.30502,26217.545
That makes sense.,26217.545,26218.52502
"By all means, though, remind me before I leave the site.",26222.16,26225.22
"You know, we will.",26226.88,26227.94
"As Luca Parmatano on your screen is being transported back to the airlock, NASA astronaut Andrew Morgan is taking inventory and cleaning up all of the tools that he has.",26232.035,26242.43
"In the meantime, we're going to take some ask NASA questions Starting with this one from Missy's fourth grade students, they want to know why astronauts have mirrors on their gloves.",26242.88998,26253.095
It's a good question.,26253.32,26254.30002
The primary reason the crew wears mirrors on their wrist is to be able to see the switches and labeling on the front of the suit that's out of their view.,26254.76,26263.455
"This is how they control things like cooling, oxygen, volume, and more.",26264.075,26268.975
The labeling on the suit is written in a mirror image because it's intended to be read via the mirror on their wrist.,26269.63,26276.29
We have another question from John who wants to know how much space suits weigh.,26288.6,26293.18002
"On Earth, space suits weigh about three hundred pounds, but, of course, that's practically nothing when in microgravity.",26293.575,26299.435
Spaceuits are also called EMUs or extra vehicular mobility units.,26300.8,26305.3
They're practically human sized spacecraft.,26305.6,26307.86002
And they have a lifetime of about fifteen years.,26308.305,26310.88498
K.,26311.425,26311.585
The next thing we wanna do is crew lock bag number two.,26311.585,26314.725
Okay.,26315.585,26316.085
Ready?,26316.43,26316.93
Hey.,26321.63,26321.95

"On the exterior, I have a small small, and that's it.",26326.165,26331.72
"On the inside, starting at the twelve o'clock position, I've got an integral ret on adjustable.",26337.0,26345.255
On that adjustable.,26351.31995,26352.3
I have empty hook and a final cutter.,26353.63995,26360.025
"Now let let me start by saying that I know that the Dinal cutter and the lancer ended up in different places, but I I have both of those tools.",26360.025,26368.07996
I see them both.,26368.07996,26369.13995
But a twelve o'clock position.,26370.6075,26372.175
I've got two accessible.,26372.175,26373.235
"And, each has one empty hook and one has the lancer and one has the Dino Okay.",26375.215,26384.48
That's good.,26384.48,26384.95996
Have down at the six required position in the integral.,26385.12,26390.675
I've got the copy caddy with the red gold and any bit.,26390.675,26400.0
And here's that that spare adjustable that we recovered from the Mad and it has my script on it.,26402.0,26410.795
Okay.,26412.775,26413.275
Copy.,26413.335,26413.835

Zip tie cutter.,26424.945002,26426.005001
"Zip tie cutter on a RET at the ten o'clock position, mister.",26431.905,26436.309998
Okay.,26437.25,26437.75
That's a good config.,26437.97,26439.11
And crew lock bag two is going back in the green bag.,26443.454998,26446.175
"We have it on hook two, but you can put it wherever you like.",26446.175,26448.995
Yep.,26451.534996,26452.034996

It's gonna be three minutes in course.,26519.685,26521.545
Help you.,26522.27,26523.009995
Starting motion.,26523.07,26523.89
Another major milestone for NASA is the development of the NASA commercial crew program.,26525.63,26531.33
And things are progressing there.,26531.625,26533.325
"Boeing rolled out its CST one hundred starliner and stacked it as well yesterday, Thursday, November twenty first.",26533.545,26541.005
On the live I have.,26542.29,26543.81

"It sets the stage for final reviews and processing, leading up toward a launch to the International Space Station currently scheduled for Tuesday, December seventeenth.",26545.81,26556.605
I hope seven.,26558.41,26559.39
"This will be an uncrewed flight, and it'll demonstrate Starliner systems ahead of the first flight test with a crew in twenty twenty.",26561.20999,26570.235
"Our other commercial crew program partner, SpaceX, completed its static fire test earlier this month, and that sets the stage for the in flight abort test.",26573.735,26582.8
That will demonstrate the crew Dragon's ability to escape any failing rocket in flight and safely return to splashdown off the Florida coast.,26583.02,26591.47499
"That demonstration date is currently planned for later this year, pending completion of reviews following the static fire test.",26592.415,26599.90001

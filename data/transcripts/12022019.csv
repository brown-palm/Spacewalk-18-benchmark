We're gonna go through this bag.,3920.69998,3922.47998
Okay.,3924.3,3924.8
"And, we had a plan for the aft airlock handrail Luca.",3924.86,3927.91998
"Next, you'll be working on your fair leads.",3928.635,3931.035
Just let me know if you want me to call them out.,3931.035,3932.795

"And, Tammy, could you would you mind reading me the the the older numbers of the expected Yeah.",3968.32,3976.6549999999997
So you're gonna start with a handrail right near the airlock.,3976.6549999999997,3979.695
It's five five four right near the hatch.,3979.695,3982.275
And then you're gonna go basically to the radio handrail.,3982.575,3985.97998
It's the four o'clock position.,3985.97998,3987.52
That's five zero four.,3988.06,3989.6
"And next day, on the circuit come pro or right on the edge of the wagon wheel is five zero three.",3990.62,3996.285

We're working it.,4043.4700000000003,4044.19
So Just do the three on the airlock and then standby one.,4044.19,4048.035
"Drew, you can start slowly wiggling the box towards the hatch.",4048.415,4052.835
Yep.,4054.81,4055.05002

"So the one over there is eight zero two four And it's, kind of, like, on the bottom part, the the nadir part of the closest, connection of ESP two.",4120.645,4132.69995
"So again, Luca Parmatano working on, configuring his tethers, hooking them to the right handrails and getting ready to receive that box, that'll be coming out the hatch.",4141.43,4151.975
"You see the, thermal cover, the sort of fabric flap that's sticking out.",4151.975,4157.495
That's where the crew will be exiting.,4157.495,4159.4349999999995
Two.,4159.54,4159.9400000000005

"The first two, peeling it, sorry to on on the airlock, at least the number three, which was five zero zero zero three.",4167.915,4181.29
Five zero three.,4181.43,4182.41
It's right on the wagon wheel.,4182.71,4184.245
"Basically, five zero four point straight at it, almost straight at it.",4184.40497,4189.545
Got it.,4192.805,4193.45

"And, work together to maneuver it over to that spot where it is now.",6143.67,6147.29
"Now, with some free hands, Morgan's gonna make his way back to the airlock and grab some tools that are necessary to complete the work here at the alpha magnetic spectrometer.",6147.98999,6157.13501
Data looks good.,6157.35501,6158.575
Met rates look good.,6158.715,6159.675
So we're in good shape.,6159.675,6160.895
Excellent.,6162.7,6163.2
Good to hear.,6163.5,6164.4
Your next job is don't let go of the box.,6167.65999,6169.995
And enjoy the view.,6170.155,6171.53499
"Two things, mutually exclusive because the view is blocked by the box, but I think I'll hold on to the box.",6177.84,6184.26

I'll be continuing.,6279.955,6280.85498
And Parmitano on his way.,6283.875,6286.13498
His job is to essentially deliver that new pump to the alpha magnetic spectrometer by way of the Canon arm two.,6292.13998,6299.985
"Morgan's job will be to retrieve some of the tools from the crew lock, that's the airlock of the International Space Station, some of the critical tools that will be needed to install the pump.",6301.88498,6313.81003
One of the tools into by Parmitano is the pistol grip tool.,6314.27002,6318.175
He'll use the drive bolts to install that pump.,6318.175,6321.055
It while we get set up for the Jocast.,6321.215,6322.895
"But some of the finer tools, specially designed for the repair of the alpha magnet spectrometer being retrieved by Morgan now.",6322.895,6330.66

"Just before, the solar rays that are pointing to the top right, fifty minutes into today's spacewalk.",6547.44995,6553.70996
Everything on track so far.,6556.48505,6557.84503
Okay.,6557.84503,6558.085
We're ready for the next Jocast.,6558.085,6559.68506
This one's gonna be three point five minutes.,6559.68506,6561.625

Ready motion.,6563.82,6564.72
Hi.,6618.265,6618.53
"As Parmitano makes his way to the alpha magnetic spectrometer worksite, on the top right, you see the external pallet delivered by the HDV eight.",6635.7,6646.025
"That's the h two transfer vehicle, a Japanese cargo vehicle that delivered lithium ion batteries earlier this year.",6648.405,6655.59
"That pallet still has three lithium ion batteries, attached to it.",6658.13,6663.165
Some of the nickel hydrogen batteries from one of the space station's power channels are already on that pallet.,6663.165,6668.605
The rest will be installed next year.,6668.605,6671.34
And at the worksite.,6725.42,6726.479996
"Okay, Drew.",6731.9,6732.72
"Crew lock bag fours going down the LC, and then you can set up the bags and the APFR.",6732.875,6739.535
And work.,6743.72,6744.45999
Andrew Morgan reporting that he's already at the work site.,6746.2,6749.34
"Parmatino, you see at the end of the station's robotic arm.",6749.715,6752.775
He's carrying the highlighted component of today.,6753.47499,6757.23499
"That's that new pump That'll give the, alpha magnetic spectrometer the life it needs.",6757.23499,6763.2
That's a cooling pump.,6763.34,6764.64
Then we'll allow the alpha magnetic spectrometer continue to collect particles throughout the life of the station.,6765.34,6771.055
So that's position hold.,6773.19499,6774.555
One moment while we load the next Jocast.,6774.555,6776.575

"In the meantime, we'll continue to answer keep using the hashtag ask NASA to send them in.",6783.58,6789.675
This question comes from David.,6792.295,6794.155
David's asking How does the alpha magnetic spectrometer collect particles?,6794.21501,6798.15
A very good question.,6798.15,6799.29
The key word there in alpha magnetic spectrometer is magnetic.,6800.87,6804.25
"There's a very powerful magnet, inside the alpha magnetic spectrometer, significantly more powerful than the magnetic field of the Earth, even.",6805.40501,6814.145
"And what the magnet does is as, cosmic rays and other cosmic particles pass through the alpha magnetic spectrometer, The magnet allows those particles to spin in a certain direction, a certain speed, a certain diameter, Net spin can be calculated and measured inside the AMS.",6816.61,6836.39
"As a data point, one of several billion.",6837.48999,6840.865
The alpha magnetic spectrometer essentially gathering data with this magnet.,6842.525,6846.385
"Measuring that, spin and what kinds of particles depending on the, direction of the spin, And the mass of the particle itself, they can detect whether it's a electron or perhaps an anti matter like positron.",6847.53,6862.515
"Both of the same mass, but if they spin in different directions, it's a data point for, No doubt.",6864.46,6872.295
As are we.,6872.295,6873.195
"Did you make use of that, adjustable there for the fairlead as well?",6873.655,6877.99503
"A data point for, more of the cosmic particles.",6879.4,6882.22
As soon as I get the bags packed down That may reveal the origins of the universe.,6882.52,6886.935
"In the meantime, Parmitano's still making his way over to the alpha magnetic spectrometer, the white structure you see sort of at the top of the trust there just before the solar arrays.",6886.935,6894.875
That's the s three trust.,6895.58002,6896.86002
That's where the alpha magnetic spectrometer's housed.,6896.86002,6899.52
"Morgan already there, getting his tools situated, getting ready for, parmitano, Making sure everything's set for when he arrives.",6900.06,6906.71503
First thing to do would be to install that new pump system.,6907.015,6909.99503

"The knob on the back there will be used, to cut the tube uniformly across the entire surface allowing for no imperfections and a nice clean-cut.",10817.9,10828.474998
"Why it's called the clean cutter, and, that allows it to be, mated to that alternate fitting for a good swage or a good connection for a tight seal.",10829.574999,10840.739998
"There's the clean cutter right now, so you can turn the turning the knob there for a nice clean-cut.",10845.434998,10849.855
"A cap at the end secured by a, a tether So whenever the tube is cut, the tether will pull away the, the cap.",10853.010002,10863.405
Yeah.,10868.92,10869.159996
"We're watching you, Luca.",10869.159996,10870.28
You're doing all the right things.,10870.28,10871.74
We had the same questions down here.,10871.799995,10873.24
You're reading our mind.,10873.24,10874.235
Yeah.,10876.635,10876.875
It was for Steven.,10876.875,10878.015
There we go.,10893.135,10893.695
Okay.,10893.695,10894.195
Okay.,10908.115,10908.59499
"That looks good, Luca.",10908.59499,10909.814995
"Now the extraordinary patience required part And, warning is that does cut, we want you to avoid contact with the hands of the tube.",10910.755,10919.61
"Again, Parmitano working with us, those specially designed tools.",10940.445,10944.545
This is a very delicate part of the procedures to clean-cut tube?,10946.765,10950.48
W a.,10950.48,10951.12
And we chose one tube.,10951.12,10952.5
"As, Jeremy Hansen here in Mission Control Houston mentions a delicate procedure and time consuming.",10956.24,10961.125
Great on time today.,10961.205,10962.16501
So we'll just take our time with this.,10962.16501,10964.245
This is exactly what we came out to do today.,10964.245,10966.985
"Drew, next as a straightener.",10992.21501,10993.675
Two six or cap for two six back to me.,11040.12999,11043.26999
Nice.,11044.91501,11045.41501
K.,11046.355,11046.595
Here's the here's the straightener.,11046.595,11048.855
"We'll see how this, works coming off the board.",11048.995,11051.41501
"A nice clean-cut by Parmitano tube six, the first of six for this worksite.",11061.3,11067.235
"The next thing he's doing is, using another tool, specially designed for this baseball called the tube straightener.",11067.935,11074.03497
Does exactly what it sounds like.,11074.64,11076.0
Make sure that tube is straight for the length that's specified in the straightener.,11076.0,11079.78
What he'll do is he'll straighten it.,11081.175,11082.53497
He'll mark it off with some Kapton tape.,11082.53497,11085.115
"That tape will, mark how far it is to be pushed into the alternate fitting for swaging.",11085.57498,11092.6
Okay.,11093.94,11094.34
"And we'll need tape next to The length must be very precise for a good swage, making sure that the connection of the tubes is good, that it's tight and sealed.",11094.34,11107.84
I see one problem with To allow the flow of carbon dioxide.,11108.54,11111.84
Restricting how we can ran for the tape here.,11112.46,11115.95502
Okay.,11115.95502,11116.275
"I have in here for, serial number seven, Tamara, George.",11116.275,11121.17502
Number seven.,11121.68002,11122.66
I'm gonna George.,11123.04,11124.08002
Now you're off the board.,11124.08002,11125.46002
Flicker came off cleanly.,11132.725,11134.10498
"So as you put that tape on, just make sure we're all the way in the window, Luca.",11147.675,11151.215
On the straightener.,11151.4,11152.3
I'm gonna double check on the outside gauge.,11154.75998,11157.09998
Copy that.,11157.88,11158.69998
Hi.,11167.915,11168.415
"To fade these all the way matching the edge so it's, plus the gauge.",11169.31,11174.93
Okay.,11176.435,11176.935
Excellent.,11176.995,11177.495
So now you can line up the AAF with the tube.,11178.195,11182.695
We'll double check the numbers.,11183.315,11184.775
And then insert it.,11184.79,11186.09
Hey.,11191.91,11192.23
I confirm I have box shot seven.,11192.23,11195.245
K.,11198.505,11199.005
"Nine six as expected, Luca.",11199.305,11201.165
Tube six has been clean-cut and marked off with tape.,11205.71,11209.00998
"Using the clean cutter and the straightener to get it ready for swaging with the, alternate fitting.",11209.655,11215.915
Alright.,11219.98,11220.38
"Ivy, I j a s.",11220.38,11222.4

It's it's definitely in past the line.,11237.85,11240.35
"Okay, Luca.",11240.97,11241.87003
"We're handing over in thirty seconds, Luca.",11242.33002,11245.755
"So you can go ahead and get ready to switch, but, how about you wait for us on the other side before you actually turn the turn the, the wrench.",11245.755,11253.56998
"Now in the middle of a short handover period, you're getting a look at the inside of the International Space Station flight control room.",11284.9,11292.755
"Teams here looking over the International Space Station Systems, as well as the procedures for today's spacewalk.",11292.915,11299.255
"Teams here led by flight director, Emily Nelson.",11300.34,11302.75998
"The voice you're hearing is Jeremy Hansen, the ground IV, communicating with the crew from here in Mission Control Houston.",11303.06,11309.095
"At the forward end of the screen, you see Jeff Ratigan, who was the flight director for the first two spacewalks.",11311.175,11315.675
Emily Nelson will be taking over for the next two.,11315.735,11318.09
"Hey, Luca.",11318.09,11318.83
We're back with you.,11319.13,11320.25
So keeping an eye on the tape and making sure it doesn't move out of the AAF at all.,11320.25,11325.675
"The key point here, especially since we're already half an inch out, you'll go ahead to give it one turn clockwise.",11325.755,11333.615
It's not quite numbers included.,11336.62,11338.88
Okay.,11340.62,11341.025
Keep an eye on the tape.,11341.025,11341.905

"Regaining, some video communications from the International Space Station, Luca Parma Tano undergoing the Swaging.",11359.315,11366.51495
"Kevin, Luca, is what you're looking for?",11366.51495,11368.34
Of the tubes.,11368.42004,11369.30005
We're back on WVS.,11369.30005,11370.44
Everything looks good.,11370.66003,11371.80005
"You see him using a wrench with the alternate fitting, that a a f?",11377.785,11381.88495
Here's the tool he's using now.,11383.44,11384.88
"There's a little bolt in the middle there, all numbered, doing a very small turn, and all he's doing is just pinching that tube to the alternate fitting.",11384.88,11393.14
To ensure a good fit and good flow of carbon dioxide.,11393.425,11396.40497
"Just a simple, seven eight seven inch, wrench there.",11401.4399999,11404.66
"A small term, but it should ensure a good fit.",11405.2799997,11408.155
He'll have to do this six times at this worksite.,11408.554999,11411.135
Hi.,11435.225,11435.53
I have foxtrot seven map and see if the date hasn't moved.,11435.85,11444.43

Next is to tighten the VLI handle.,11450.395,11452.575
"Remember, give it a good firm, tighten, and then we'll cycle the cap, close everything up.",11452.84,11458.14
"And I don't know how we we didn't really talk about this about taking a photo of these, prior to putting the MOI on.",11459.945,11465.785
I don't know if that's practical or not.,11465.785,11467.565
But we are doing reasonable on time today.,11469.43,11472.07001
That seemed to go pretty smooth.,11472.07001,11473.590004
So we probably could take a foot.,11473.590004,11475.985
Photo of the with a photo of what?,11476.145004,11479.685
A photo of the AF before you pull the MLI over.,11479.985,11483.125
Yep.,11484.225,11484.625

That's that orange tape.,14541.98999,14543.405
"And that'll, be the marker for how far to put the tube into the alternate fitting.",14544.845,14549.58499
"That alternate fitting can be, used with a wrench to drive a bolt that, swages the tubes or sort of pinches them.",14550.285,14562.235
And that pinch will ensure a nice seal.,14563.195,14565.455
"Seals will be checked on the next space walk, but for now, The clean cutting and swaging continues.",14568.315,14573.21

I got these tucked away.,18232.545,18234.085
Either flap is away.,18238.18001,18239.8
"So in the BLI, one turn inside, and I still have bravo seven.",18241.78,18252.015
Okay.,18253.18,18253.68
"Good words, Luca.",18253.73999,18254.8
"Next, we're gonna read to the caps through.",18256.3,18259.04
"Hey, Ben.",18259.705,18261.245
"Luca, which cap do you think you'll cut first?",18262.26498,18264.585
I've got number two first because that's what I have to stop it.,18264.585,18267.705
If you would put this hook onto cap number too.,18267.705,18270.75
K.,18270.89,18271.21
Let me Now the technique that we used was just putting it on both of them at this the same time.,18271.21,18278.915
Yep.,18281.215,18281.535
And this other hook will go to four.,18281.535,18283.39502
Alright.,18291.71,18292.21
Wait right now.,18292.27,18293.17
"Have reopened back four for, you know, for, excuse me, back three.",18293.47,18299.185
"So I don't know if that means that we have to inventory it again, but to open the matting, two plugs in the caps.",18299.185,18308.66
"I'll let you know, Drew.",18314.20502,18315.505
"Luca, we probably can give you a little bit more pitch too if you do need it.",18320.32,18324.02
Okay.,18327.765,18328.265
Morgan handing off the clean cutter tool.,18341.4,18343.98
"Now that a tether is attached to the caps, they can cut the caps without them floating away.",18344.945,18350.885
"This clean cutter will allow a, Very even clean-cut around the tubes without any bending of the tube itself to allow Good flow of carbon dioxide for the cooling of alpha magnet spectrometer?",18351.185,18364.85498
"Hey, Drew, we are gonna grab an inventory on that bag just to double check.",18368.61002,18372.07
"You probably got time now, well, Luca's clean cutting if you want.",18375.715,18379.335
"Well, let's say we just we just inventory back three.",18381.235,18385.65
I'm suggesting that we wait.,18385.65,18387.00998
And I I was asking if we need to do it after I were I get these two plugs in caps.,18387.00998,18392.06998
Yeah.,18398.025,18398.525
"So if if you basically, Drew, you can do it as if you inventory it, then keep it under control while you just add the two caps, that's considered an inventory complete.",18398.665,18408.18
"But since everything got let out of the bag, then we are gonna do a full inventory.",18408.18,18411.995
"But we're happy waiting until we got the caps in there, and we're doing good on time line.",18411.995,18415.435
So we'll have the time for the inventory.,18415.435,18417.61502
Roger.,18419.72,18420.22
"Next for you, Drew's tape.",18434.105,18435.725
"And, actually, the other thing I need from you, Drew, is a glove and half here.",18472.74,18476.225
Copy.,18479.005,18479.505
App is dry.,18480.445,18481.345
Yeah.,18483.165,18483.43
And I let's not change.,18483.50998,18486.49
Correct.,18486.94998,18487.44998
And if I got a backness.,18488.38998,18490.97
Right.,18493.655,18494.135
"Two four or cap cap two is is, retained on the adjustable Do you want me to have kept number four as well before administrating them?",18494.45502,18506.45
Yes.,18507.31,18507.81
That's the technique.,18508.03497,18509.01498
"But if you have another way you wanna do it, Luca, there's no problem, but that's what we're planning to do.",18509.395,18514.615
K.,18516.195,18516.595
On to that plate.,18516.595,18517.95
"Need to stay in there again, Drew.",18521.13,18522.89
"Oh, yeah.",18522.89,18523.45
We won't I'm sorry.,18523.45,18524.685
"The, clean colors are in the clean cabinets.",18524.825,18527.465
Yeah.,18527.465,18527.965
"So the only thing here is we gotta make sure we not super critical, but we wanna not mix up these tubes, Luca.",18529.145,18536.07
"Once we clean-cut it, we're not gonna have an indicator of what's what?",18536.53,18540.07
Yeah.,18542.625,18542.945
I look at it.,18542.945,18544.005
"I almost wanna do it standard, Jeremy.",18544.785,18547.925
There's no issue with that.,18549.57,18550.77
"However, what we did notice in training was that when you try to clean-cut with the AAF attached to that other tube, it it can be quite cumbersome.",18550.77,18558.79004
"And as we know, we can back out of if we do swap out the tubes, we can back out of it by some changes in the pump box.",18560.785,18567.17
Alright.,18568.85,18569.35
Dispute through this one balance is through this is two is what I have before.,18570.61,18577.89496
K.,18578.51495,18579.01495
Yep.,18579.235,18579.735
Yep.,18581.795,18582.295
Okay.,18584.11,18584.43
"We got one more idea, Luca.",18584.43,18585.87
"What if you wanna straighten and tape, you can do that before you swage if you wanna mark too.",18585.87,18592.435
It's a good idea.,18594.015,18594.815
And then we'll have a serial number to call.,18594.815,18596.895
Right?,18596.895,18597.395
Yeah.,18597.455,18597.955
Alright.,18598.335,18598.735

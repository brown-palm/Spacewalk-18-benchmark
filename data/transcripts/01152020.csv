"We are live from Mission Control Houston at NASA Johnson Space Center, where the orbit two team has taken over And the orbit one team has recently left.",756.455,765.77
They were walking the crew through the suit up and pre breathing and other spacewalk preparations this morning.,765.77,771.31
Flight Director today is Judd Freeling.,772.135,774.0550000000001
"He is leading all the flight controllers on the ground through today's spacewalk, gathering information from each console.",774.0550000000001,780.075
The ground IV is Stephanie Wilson.,781.15,783.09

"He will pass the communications to the ground IV or Stephanie Wilson, as you can see to his right, once the Quest hatch is closed and depressurization is underway.",806.405,816.34
He will also serve as today's capcom for the other astronauts working aboard the space station.,817.52,822.1
The lead space walk officer or the lead EVA officer for today is Sandy Fletcher.,823.905,828.565
"She oversees the team, monitors suit information with them, and walk through the procedures feeding information to the teams on the ground.",828.9449999999999,836.14
Those are just a few of the team members that are helping the astronauts accomplish their task today.,845.5849900000001,850.18001
"As you can see, Christina Cook and Jessica Meir have been moved into the crew lock section of the West airlock.",854.08,860.345
The Quest airlock is divided into two portions.,860.485,862.985
"The They are now on the crew lock in the other portion, which you can see Andrew Morgan in is the equipment lock.",863.525,877.7049999999999
That's where they were suited up this morning.,877.7049999999999,879.9649999999999
"Earlier today, they donned their spacesuit They're formerly known as extra vehicular mobility units or EMUs.",881.4649999999999,887.65
Those space suits are essentially individual human sized spacecraft and they each contain their own portable life support system.,888.4300000000001,895.5349699999999
"A few times today, as we see just now, we will have some satellite handovers where we lose temporary communication with the International Space Station but these are tracked, and we can still, walk the astronauts through their procedures as they prepare to move outside of the hatch.",903.5,918.7149999999999
"A little bit more about the space suits that astronauts are wearing today, engineers on the ground take about eighty measurements to ensure each of the spacewalkers has a best fitting spacesuit.",929.515,939.81998
These are some of the most difficult tasks astronauts accomplish when going on a spacewalk.,940.36,944.6949999999999
And so it's important that they have the proper fit to make sure that they can accomplish them perfectly.,944.995,949.815
There are about sixteen major elements that compose a space suit.,950.77,954.15
"Some of those include, the option of three different sizes of torsos, small, medium, and large, There are actually eight sizes of elbow joint pieces, two adjustable waist sizes, and even five sizes of knee joints.",954.28998,968.19498
"Most impressive, however, is there are sixty five sizes of gloves or the astronauts might have custom fitted gloves since all of the work is done with their hands.",970.6600000000001,980.4549999999999
"The white part of the space suit that you see on the outside is not the only piece of the space suit, they're also wearing a cooling garment underneath.",984.115,991.28
"Since the space station orbits the earth, about every ninety minutes, the astronauts are constantly going in and out of sunlight.",991.74,998.655
"When the space station's in sunlight, it can be two hundred and fifty degrees outside, but in darkness, it's negative two hundred fifty degrees.",999.115,1006.5550000000001
So This cooling garment helps them regulate their temperature throughout the spacewalk.,1006.5550000000001,1010.8399999999999
Ashronauts also add padding to their space suit as needed to various parts for comfort and better fit.,1014.245,1020.66498
"On the back of the space suit, which you can see there with the American flag is called the SAFER or the simplified aid for EVA rescue.",1027.83,1035.295
That's a compressed nitrogen powered backpack essentially that allows a crew member to maneuver independently of the space station.,1036.315,1043.27
It's primarily intended for use of a spacewalker becomes detached from the station and needs to maneuver back.,1043.65,1049.76498
"However, astronauts are always wearing tethers when outside of the hatch, and so we don't often see the safer used.",1049.825,1056.725
"This morning while the crew were inside the equipment, portion of the Quest Airlock.",1083.1,1087.275
"They also conducted the in suit light exercise protocol, also known as IL.",1087.815,1092.635
This helps them acclimate their bodies to the lower pressure inside the suit and helps the astronauts avoid the bends.,1093.02,1099.26
It's something that deep sea divers also have to worry about.,1099.26,1102.4
Helps them purge the nitrogen in their blood very slowly.,1102.475,1105.375
So they will exercise mostly just moving their arms and legs.,1105.595,1109.215
"For a for, just under a minute and then they take a break.",1109.56998,1116.0700000000002
We mentioned that the pressure inside the suit is a little bit lower.,1128.5700000000002,1132.02997
"And at nominal pressure, the suit is about four point three pounds per square inch.",1132.375,1137.0149999999999
"To put that into context, the atmospheric pressure we're used to on earth's surface is about fourteen point seven pounds per square inch.",1137.0149999999999,1144.87
That's also the pressure of the inside of the international space station.,1144.9299999999998,1148.7099600000001
With a mixed oxygen and nitrogen environment just like we're used to on earth.,1148.855,1153.175
So the four point three pounds per square inch that the astronauts are experiencing inside their suit is similar to what we'd experience at about thirty thousand feet elevation.,1153.175,1162.4299999999998
"Low pressure inside the space suit allows for more flexibility for these astronauts, which is crucial when flexing the rigid gloves during a six and a half hour spacewalk.",1176.60004,1185.4450000000002
"The space station is currently flying two hundred and fifty eight statute miles over Houston, Texas, where teams here on the ground at NASA's Johnson Space Center are conducting some of the, final communication and suit systems checks with the astronauts who are in the crew lock portion of the Quest airlock.",1284.48,1301.405
"You send the airlock one, step sixty three decimal six.",1336.66501,1341.53
It's zero numbers zero four and zero one eight.,1341.53,1344.27
Good number.,1350.155,1350.715
"Thanks, Drew.",1350.715,1351.535
You can see Commander Luca Parmatano beginning to close the hatch of the Quest airlock separating the crew lock portion from the equipment lock.,1416.935,1425.595
"Once that hatch is closed, the pressurization will begin, and the astronauts will switch their suits onto internal battery power That officially marks the beginning of our spacewalk.",1435.815,1446.19
To count to four one.,1546.655,1548.195
"Go ahead, Luca.",1549.35,1550.33

"And, no, there is nothing here.",27108.035,27109.895004
"I can just see I mean, I can see the loop that it was cut on.",27110.035,27112.475006
I don't know if you can see in my WVS.,27112.475006,27113.895004
"Are these loops that have, like, a gap spanner holding the thermal blanket on, and it would get through one of those loops.",27116.26,27122.28
And we copy.,27123.335,27124.134995
"We have a good visual, good inspection.",27124.134995,27125.895
We show that complete.,27125.895,27127.034996
You can continue.,27127.575,27128.39499
K.,27130.69499,27131.19499
We're now six and a half hours into today's space walk.,27141.405,27144.705
The space walk off was scheduled to last six and a half hours.,27145.565,27148.64
"However, the crew had good consumables, meaning they had enough water and oxygen for the spacewalk to last a little longer.",27148.64,27155.29999
That's why teams went ahead and proceeded with that extra get ahead task of moving battery four to the external palette.,27155.385,27162.44499
"That also puts teams in a good configuration for the next spacewalk on Monday, January twentieth.",27164.72,27169.78
"Now there will only be two nickel hydrogen batteries left to be removed, and one lithium ion battery left to be installed.",27170.105,27177.00499
Our spacewalkers are now cleaning up and starting to head back to the International Space Station Quest airlock as the station flies two hundred and sixty statue two miles over Nigeria in an orbital nighttime.,27194.90001,27206.875
Okay.,27219.35999,27219.84
"So speaking to my clear off bag, I do have it.",27219.84,27223.28499
"I have it get structure, but the door is down.",27224.22499,27226.965
"Copy, Christina, and one minute to thirty seconds to, sunset.",27238.27501,27244.455
Okay.,27247.155,27247.655
"And Jessica, speak a little bit because wait.",27249.21,27253.53
So you're here.,27253.53,27254.01001
Can you tell me what you think about this?,27254.01001,27256.59
Could make this flap by extending between that tube and the other side of this handrail.,27256.97498,27262.41498
I think that's maybe what I do.,27262.41498,27264.115
What's that?,27266.73,27267.87
Yeah.,27268.01,27268.33002
"Because the, PSU is a little bit it makes the bag of the door a little bit kind of at an angle, not flat against structure.",27268.33002,27280.875
"I see that I think that's what I mean, I think it's a cheese list with the aim of having the ligand structure, but to be a hundred percent sure.",27280.875,27290.845
I'm gonna move for this.,27290.845,27292.145
I like that now that I've got it on the fry handle.,27325.88998,27328.07
I'm comfortable with that.,27328.815,27330.01498
Christina take a look.,27330.01498,27330.97498
On the right?,27331.055,27331.875
Crewlock bag config is good.,27331.935,27333.79498
"And, here are the lights, Jessica.",27337.57,27339.91
Okay.,27340.13,27340.45
"Standby, why don't we work on this, Lee?",27340.45,27343.67
What do you think?,27344.91498,27345.47498
Do you think it'll be easier to attach it if I leave this on my BRT like this?,27345.47498,27349.095
Or do you wanna go with the bag off?,27349.155,27350.595
No.,27350.595,27350.715
I think it might be because then it's just it's stable.,27350.715,27353.91998
"If you wanna hold your position, I can try and attach it.",27354.22,27357.34
Okay.,27357.34,27357.58
"And then we need to get, like, GoPro back in to do.",27357.58,27359.9
Okay.,27359.9,27360.4
"So, hopefully, you can do that without putting up Pandora's box.",27362.185,27366.285
"Christina, Jessica.",27368.24,27369.2
"So, certainly, if you have a thoughts on how to, stow the helmet light onto the ORU bag, that also works, the suggestion here is to use the to, have the gimbal light assembly be on the front of the bag and the back of the bag so that the large, small ret that's stowed towards the lid of the bag, you can use that large hook to go around the gimbal, the interface between the battery and the light.",27369.2,27397.445
"And then there's a small, small adjustable on the other side of the bag.",27397.665,27401.64
"And you can loop that also around the gimbal and, tether tether one hook to the inside frame of the helmet.",27401.88,27410.7
Okay.,27412.415,27412.915
And we so she stopped that they took now because she could put that on the gimbal.,27413.615,27417.795
And then there's already a small small going to the frame.,27418.53,27422.79
"Once that's on the gimbal, I can just move this small small over to the for you guys.",27422.93,27428.185
Okay.,27428.32498,27428.645
Copy.,27428.645,27429.145
"And were were those all those points of connection that you said, or did you want a second one on the on handle or two connection plates out of it?",27431.04498,27438.93002
Nope.,27439.39,27439.63
K.,27439.63,27440.13
Okay.,27443.205,27443.60498
It's stabilizing.,27443.60498,27444.26498
Move the light hand a bit.,27445.205,27446.585
"I kinda make it more, like, gimbal, the room around the gimbal.",27447.76498,27452.64
"Jessica, Christina, we think that two connection points are good.",27453.68002,27457.06003
Okay.,27460.56003,27460.96002
I've got a large around one side.,27460.96002,27464.385
Okay.,27464.385,27464.86502
"And I'll go ahead and remove the adjustable from the crew lock bag on one side, and then attach it to the smaller e bag.",27464.86502,27471.285
You wanna look at that camera in first because okay.,27481.725,27485.005
And that might be and Another option if they would be immutable is to just have someone put it on their swing arm outside the way in.,27485.005,27494.45
"Or or even or do you think it's oh, I think it actually looks pretty, like, fit right in right here.",27495.555,27500.595
It it's all fit.,27500.595,27501.395
Okay.,27501.395,27501.715
"I mean, it came out in it.",27501.715,27502.83
"So but, yeah, funny.",27502.83,27504.07
I mean I might not loosen that.,27504.07,27505.67
Okay.,27505.67,27506.17
I'll try and put it in.,27507.43002,27508.71002
K.,27508.71002,27509.03
I just said without letting you step out.,27509.03,27510.835
I'll try to hold the lid here.,27511.155,27512.515
"If you can stuff it in, then we'll see if that works.",27512.515,27514.755
Perfect.,27514.755,27515.255
"And if showing the GoPro inside the bag does not work, you're seeing a swing arm is also options.",27516.675,27521.32
Okay.,27530.79504,27531.29504
"Oh, Let's see if we can get the lid back on top because I think that's what's loosen up a little bit right there.",27537.11505,27544.985
Go from the lid.,27545.305,27546.445
Okay.,27555.12994,27555.62994
"Now, tighten it.",27558.97,27559.85
I'll keep your hand on it.,27559.85,27560.81
Okay.,27560.81,27561.31

I might help you see more.,27583.54504,27585.245
Okay.,27586.425,27586.825
Just Wait.,27586.825,27588.56
Okay.,27588.56,27589.06
I've got it kind of sandwich.,27589.92,27591.22003
Right.,27591.84,27592.08
"I'll put it I think do you think about on the, handrail extension?",27592.08,27597.115
"My if it reaches, I think that will keep it nice",27597.815,27600.0
I it would.,27600.0,27600.96
"I just don't wanna get in the way if you Well, I'm already BRT.",27600.96,27605.44
I'm sorry.,27605.44,27606.18
Removing it.,27606.3999996,27607.12
You don't think that'll be the same?,27607.12,27609.059999
"I think it should be okay removing the BRT, and you can leave it on, sell inside.",27612.805,27617.305
And on the rack?,27617.789999,27618.349998
As long as it's not on the same side as my gear too rack.,27619.39,27621.63
Yeah.,27621.63,27621.71
That's where it is.,27621.71,27622.509998
"It would be, but you know what, there's a tether point over here, and I could snag it.",27622.509998,27626.529999
So I think we're good.,27626.785,27627.585
I'm gonna go around the corner of this bag and then tighten up the description twice.,27627.585,27631.285
Hey.,27638.34,27638.5
Hey.,27638.5,27638.82

I do.,27662.195,27662.855
Yep.,27663.715,27664.215
We just saw Jessica Mere and Christina Cook reattaching that light and video the portion of Christina Cook's helmet that became detached earlier in the spacewalk.,27666.56,27678.135
"The inconvenience set them back about thirty minutes, but the team worked fast enough that they were able to make up that time and then have some extra to accomplish their get ahead task.",27682.5,27691.399994
Hi.,27757.51999,27757.915
"Jessica, before you take off, I'll take your light showing you down here just so that I can verify when I remove One how could the adjustable?",27778.065,27784.56
Did I remove the right one?,27784.62,27786.64
Okay.,27786.7,27787.2
One that's pulling to the d ring?,27787.73999,27789.44

"Oh, I think that is good.",27793.52501,27795.30501
Let me confirm I am leaving the adjustable here.,27798.80501,27801.385
Your correct dot is confirmed.,27803.41,27805.03
Okay.,27807.09,27807.49
It is still attached to the handrail?,27807.49,27809.35
Any other tasks for me before I head to my green hook?,27810.22499,27813.20499
"Christina, once you're happy with, retrieving your fair lead and leaving the adjustable, you can, also translate to your green hook, p six fifty three eighty eight.",27831.425,27842.89
"As the astronauts begin their journey back to the Quest airlock of the International Space Station, we reached the six hour and forty two minute point in today's spacewalk.",27850.865,27860.44
"A recap of everything that the astronauts have accomplished today, they first installed battery one in the external pallet z slot.",27862.705,27872.0
APFR that I was in.,27872.22,27873.76
This meant removing the nickel hydrogen battery from its current spot on the integrated electronics assembly.,27873.9,27880.82498
"They then moved the battery f into slot one, battery f being a new lithium ion battery and moved on to battery two.",27882.32498,27891.03
That's a nickel hydrogen battery that was moved to the external palette in slot f.,27891.03,27895.29
And the adapter plate that had been in slot f was moved to slot two of the integrated electronic assembly.,27897.465,27903.245
"The duo moved battery three to adapter plate f slot two, and that's the adapter plate that had just been moved from the external palette before moving battery e.",27909.36002,27920.51498
A lithium ion battery to slot three on the integrated electronic assembly.,27921.61002,27927.31
The team even had time to move battery four and nickel hydrogen battery to the external pallet in slot y.,27930.155,27937.77502
And this is a good get ahead for the next spacewalk.,27937.96,27940.62
"Christina, we're back with you after handover.",27940.75998,27942.78
"In total, that means three old three old nickel hydrogen batteries were moved to the external palette today, and one old Nich hydrogen battery is now on the integrated electronic assembly.",27946.495,27959.06
Two new lithium batteries have been installed on the inter integrated electronic assembly.,27959.6,27965.315
In the next space walk scheduled for January twentieth and just a few days from now.,27971.62,27975.7
"You know, I did bump the yaw.",27975.7,27977.96002
"The role, I think, was also out on that APFR It's no problem.",27978.18002,27983.01498
"I mean, I can adjust it when we come back to the next EVA, but if it's it might need to The fourth space walk we will see the two nickel hydrogen batteries, the final two on the port six truss moved to the external pallet, and the final Lithium ion battery will be installed.",27983.01498,27999.495
Did we have any need to put this back in a config for robotics reasons.,28014.85,28020.025
Only away it's away from the AP.,28022.725,28025.785
"Oh, I think it's okay.",28026.38,28027.66
"But, Stephanie?",28027.66,28028.64

Thanks for the question.,28041.93002,28042.97
Clearance should be good for the arm.,28043.29,28044.65002
We'll get it on the next DBA.,28044.65002,28046.19
I'm right next to you.,28069.195,28070.575
Yeah.,28082.925,28083.16498
I'm at my Greenhut.,28083.16498,28084.145

That was Christina.,28094.73,28095.63
But I I have my green hook on my radio.,28095.85,28100.41498
So I'm ready to get out of Christina's way.,28101.91498,28104.095
"Copy, Jessica.",28106.99,28107.73
Hi.,28124.745,28125.14
"Jessica, if you wouldn't mind holding holding there for a bit so I can retrieve my green hook.",28179.15,28184.265
Your lighting.,28184.965,28185.705
"Oh, that's that's perfect.",28190.14,28191.68
Okay.,28212.845,28213.085
And I retrieved my green hook.,28213.085,28214.705
We can head in.,28214.924999,28216.305
Okay.,28217.189999,28217.509998
And I can see that we have a loop around our tethers right now.,28217.509998,28222.09
I wanna see if I can if it clears I see that yours is around with Trendian here.,28222.23,28226.845
"So if I can clear that, let me see if that helps.",28226.845,28230.224998
And I can also hang tight at the tether at the anchor point like we talked about.,28234.33,28239.07
You need to do a twist there.,28239.29,28240.910004
I'm just gonna come down here if I can take a look at it.,28258.144997,28260.545
Okay.,28260.545,28261.045
"I'll stay here so that my, skills are making that harder.",28261.105,28266.69
"So I can see that they are the tethers are lifted, inboard of me.",28293.225,28299.485
I don't know that it's gonna matter when we get back to our anchor hook.,28300.39,28303.93
"Right now, you're I mean, that those functioning, they're just twisting around each other.",28304.07,28308.39
Okay.,28308.39,28308.89
"So I think that it's best to proceed in and then assess at the inquiries if Stephanie, if you concur.",28310.185,28315.645004
We concur.,28319.92,28320.74
Okay.,28328.305,28328.805
And it's actually Christina if you hold for a minute and let me translate a bit in.,28333.31,28336.43

So that would be.,28336.75,28337.73
"Oh, stop me.",28401.61,28402.67
Twenty seconds to twenty second handover.,28412.04,28413.98
Bobby?,28419.4,28419.9
The astronauts are continuing to make their way to the Quest airlock.,28456.04498,28459.26498
"Christina, if you hold there again, when you're too close, I think, you know, your tether gets really loose.",28463.03,28467.37
"It is right in front of me, so I keep almost getting hot now.",28467.99,28470.97
Yes.,28471.29248,28471.395
I will hold for longer.,28471.555,28472.675
Sure thing.,28472.675,28473.41498
"You know, I'll wait for your waves on board.",28473.715,28475.895

"And, Jessica?",28505.97498,28507.035
Hi.,28525.835,28526.335
"Christina, since you are following Jessica back to the airlock, for the port for the c to cart breaks, do you feel you'll have enough light to do those?",28531.97,28541.375
I do think I will.,28543.11502,28544.415
Awesome.,28545.36,28545.68

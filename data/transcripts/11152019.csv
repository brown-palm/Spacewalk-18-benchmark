"You are looking live inside the station's Quest Airlock where two astronauts, expedition sixty one commander, Luca Parmatino, of the European Space Agency on your right, and NASA flight engineer, Drew Morgan, on your left, are suited up ready to begin the first of at least four complex spacewalks to repair an invaluable cosmic gray detector on the truss of the orbital outpost.",12.905,34.775
The alpha magnetic spectrometer delivered to the International Space Station eight and a half years ago to study intricate cosmic events in the universe in the hope of better understanding dark matter and anti matter in the search for answers to the origin of the cosmos has been failing in recent years.,35.68,51.745
The AMS tracker thermal control system or TTCS as you will hear it referred to consists of two independent cooling loops with two pumps a piece to route carbon dioxide through the detector systems.,52.3,65.345
Those pumps have been degrading over time.,65.885,68.065
Three out of the four pumps have failed.,68.525,70.365
The last pump is failing only operating on an intermittent basis under certain thermal conditions.,70.365,75.89
A separate leak of carbon dioxide from the AMS' cooling system has added to the instruments current deteriorating condition.,76.35,83.15501
A new pump module called the upgraded tracker thermal pump system or UTTS contains four pumps and a resupply of carbon dioxide to enable AMS to function through the lifetime of the international space station.,83.935005,97.58
"The permanent shutdown of the old tracker thermal control system and the installation of the new upgraded tracker thermal pump system will bypass the existing failing loop, pumps, and will combine the two current cooling loops into a single more robust cooling loop.",98.115,112.86
This new pump package that will be mounted onto the AMS' existing pump system was launched to the International Space Station a few weeks ago courtesy of Northrop Grumman's Cygnus cargo craft.,113.205,124.25
"The spacewalks, which will all be conducted by Parmatano and Morgan, are considered to be the most complicated excursions since the space shuttle servicing missions to the Hubble Space Telescope, using more than twenty unique tools specifically designed and developed for the tasks at hand.",124.79,139.81999
"The two veteran spacewalkers will remove thermal insulation, a debris shield the current cooling loop supply of carbon dioxide and then perform intricate invasive work to cut stainless steel tubing and flex lines performing what in essence will be bypass surgery to equip the new pump assembly with the reconstructed cooling lines as well as power and data connections.",139.87999,161.72
"These space walks, were first designed and, began to be formulated some four years ago with a cast of thousands bringing us to this day, the first of at least four spacewalks to repair the alpha magnetic spectrometer.",163.32501,178.69
"Today's spacewalk will be two hundred twenty second space walk in support of ISS assembly maintenance and upgrades, the ninth space walk out of the international space station this year, The third spacewalk for Luca Parmatano.",186.755,199.855

"Christina Cook, who has been the prime, to help suit up, Luca Parmitano and Drew Morgan this morning, in the near field of view is NASA astronaut, Jessica Mir, who has been assisting Cook in the suit up procedures and will be the prime robotic operator operating the Kennadarn two robotic arm to maneuver Luca Parmatano around during all four spacewalks into various, tight spaces in the worksite on the starboard three truss of the international space station, where the alpha magnetic spectrometer is located.",235.32501,266.56
"As you see on the right, Luca parmitano, with the Italian flag on his left shoulder.",267.02,270.89502
"He is designated as EV one or extra vehicular crew member number one for, today's space walk wearing the suit bearing the red stripes his helmet camera, the view that you will see, basically over his shoulder, as he performs work outside of the International Space Station today, will have the number designation of eleven in the lower right hand corner of your screen once those helmet cam reviews are activated.",270.89502,296.125
"Drew Morgan on your left is desert designated today as EV two or extra vehicular crew member number two wearing the suit with no stripes his helmet cam camera number when you see the views, over his shoulder today will be number eighteen.",296.63,311.625
"As we look, at, Morgan on your left, parmitano, on your in real time here today, as they are right on the timeline preparing for a spacewalk that is scheduled to begin at approximately six zero five AM central time, We dialed back the clock twenty four hours to yesterday where, Morgan and Parmatano in the airlock preparing their suits paid homage on the fiftieth anniversary of the launch of Apollo twelve on humanity's second lunar landing on the moon.",334.41,362.945
"They wore, black, horn rim glasses, black skinny ties and white shirts, just as NASA flight controllers did in the, Apollo flight control room fifty years ago for the Apollo twelve mission under the command of Pete Conrad along with Dick Gordon and, the late Alan Bean who, whose name is born on the Cygnus, a cargo craft that arrived at the International Space Station just a couple of weeks ago.",363.38998,389.25998
"This was now back into our live view of the airlock as, Jessica Mirr, and Christina Cook, are preparing to help the crew Don safer jetpacks.",389.25998,400.44
You see the word safer.,400.66,401.69998
"That is the acronym for simplified aid for EVA Rescue, jet powered backpacks that are affixed to the back of the crew member's suits, so that they have a, propulsive capability in the highly unlikely event they would become untethered during the course of today's spacewalk.",401.69998,417.36
It was May sixteenth twenty eleven when the space shuttle endeavor lifted off from its launch pad at the Kennedy Space Center on its final flight.,438.53,446.105
The alpha magnetic spectrometer nestled at the rear of its cargo bay On route to the International Space Station to deliver this cosmic ray detector that will be the subject of all of the work associated with at least for spacewalks to repair and replace its cooling system.,446.565,461.77502
This view shows the alpha magnetic spectrometer being lifted out of the cargo bay with the shuttles robotic arm that was operated by Drew Feustel and Roberto Vitore of the European Space Agency.,462.23502,473.52002
"They handed off the AMS, to the Canadarm two robotic arm under the controls of NASA astronauts, Greg Shamatov, and Greg Box Johnson, who installed the AMS on the starboard three truss of the international space station where it currently resides to this day having acquired some one hundred forty billion detections of cosmic ray events in the universe and the study of dark matter and anti matter.",474.06,499.645
"The International Space Station is currently flying over the Western Pacific on a trajectory from southwestern northeast and an orbit inclined fifty one point six degrees to either side of the equator, orbiting at an altitude of some two hundred fifty five statute miles.",525.585,539.47003
"The, space walk, that is looming on the horizon today for Luca Parmitano and Drew Morgan, again, the first of at least four excursions outside of the Quest airlock to repair the alpha magnetic spectrometer.",540.335,551.71
"Today's spacewalk is essentially a scene center, in which, work will be done, to prepare for some of the more invasive work that will take place, in the space walks to follow.",552.25,563.335
John Malarski is the lead space walk officer for all of these alpha magnetic spectrometer repair excursions.,563.94,569.80005
"He recently sat down and provided a narrated view of, through the animation and our virtual reality laboratory of what you will see later today as Parmatano and Morgan conduct their spacewalk.",570.34,583.31
Crew will be starting out on the first of the AMS repair EVAs.,589.825,592.865
"Here we've got Luca Parmatano as EV one, and Drew Morgan as EV two.",592.865,597.62494
Luca is here picking up the WIF extender,597.62494,599.96497
To install on the end of the can to arm too.,600.24,603.3799999
"While Drew is, bringing out some tool bags, stowing them on the outside of the airlock, and also bringing some with him to translate up the truss as well.",603.6,609.865
"Here Lucas proceeding up to meet the Canon arm too, where he will start configuring that for the start of his repair series.",611.224999,617.3
"From here, Drew will pass by, Luca, head all the way out to AMS to the Express Logistics carrier too, where he will start setting up bags.",620.9,629.365
Drew will make several trips between the airlock and the express logistics carrier in order to bring all the tools for the repair out to the worksite and have them staged and ready for what Luca's arrival with the SSRMS.,629.585,639.5
"So here, Luca will be setting up that with extender, followed by the articulating portable foot restraint, which will give him the reach necessary to on the repairs on AMS since there are no handrails currently installed on that payload for repair activities.",642.335,655.93
"Once Luca has his tool bag and is on the end of the SSRMS, he will fly a sweeping range of motion that will take him well over top of the ISS, where he'll get a great view of the space station, and then it will take lots of video and photos that we can use to keep an eye on the state of the station.",660.245,677.59
"As the arm is stretched out and wrapped around the AMS, there will be several places of tight clearances.",678.345,682.585
"The arm operators will have to negotiate for Lucas at the, aft and outboard work site here.",682.585,688.03
You can see him flying up over top of the dress where the arm will wrap around the backside of AMS and push him in between AMS and the ELC in order to reach the worksite to repair AMS' thermal pump system.,689.549995,703.245
"Once Luca is at that worksite, he'll be removing a debris shield working with Drew, but to access the primary work area of the AMS repair.",709.46999,717.475
"Here, they're installing a handling aid that'll be used to handle this debris shield after it's removed.",717.6949999999999,722.115
There are about a dozen non captive fasteners that'll be removed in order to release this debris shield.,723.615,728.2099900000001
"Several will be under these captured cages, and they'll be trapped that way, and several will be released using capture forks to be put into a separate capture block so that they are managed and not released as fun.",728.2099900000001,739.345
"Once all the faster to release for the debris shield, Luca will hand it off to Drew who will be in his own foot restraint.",742.97,747.71
And he will face aft on the ISS and jettison that debris shield.,747.965,751.50499
"Due to its large size, it is not easy to put that back at the airlock.",752.125,755.965
So jettison is the optimum choice for that shield.,755.965,759.25
"Once the debris shield has been removed in Jettison, Luca and Drew will work together to install other handrails, Here, we've installed the first, three handrails, the diado beam handrail, then, Drew will hand over two more handrails that Luca will install that they are the vacuum case handrails.",761.15,776.83
This will allow Luca drew better access and mobility at the worksite in preparation for the second through fourth EVA of the series.,776.83,783.5699999999999
"Following the handrail installation, crews will close-up their tool bags and make their way back to the airlock.",785.015,790.315
Herraluka is on the end of the arm.,790.455,792.0550000000001
It will repeat his translation on the end of the arm.,792.0550000000001,794.26
Back to the front of trust.,794.58,796.04
"While he's flying on the arm, Drew will translate around the outside of ELC, and translate back under the mobile transporter back to the airlock before the end of the first of the AMS repair EVAs.",797.14,808.265
"That's a a snapshot of, today's initial spacewalk, the first of at least four spacewalks to repair the alpha magnetic spectrometer.",810.15,824.525
"Back now live inside the quest airlock Christina Cook on the right, along with Jessica Mirre about to assist Luca Parmatano wearing the suit bearing the red stripe into the crew lock section of Quested as a two compartment airlock, once he and Drew Morgan are sa safely snuggled inside the crew lock, that hatch will closed setting the stage for the depressurization of, the airlock itself, that will be the precursor to the two crew members placing their suits on internal battery power to mark the official start of today's spacewalks, a US based spacewalk is measured.",825.70499,860.225
The elapsed time is measured From the time the crew places their suits on internal battery power until the time the airlock is repressurized at the conclusion of the spacewalk when they're safely back inside.,860.225,871.45
The orbit two team of flight controllers is conducting a handover from the orbit one team.,874.07498,878.5550000000001
"The orbit two team will be executing today's spacewalk under the direction of flight director, Jeff Ratigan, will talk more about the players on console in a moment.",878.5550000000001,886.9799800000001
"One of the prominent figures that you'll be hearing throughout the course of today's plan six and a half hour space walk is the so called ground IV or intra vehicular crew member essentially a spacewalk CAPCOM or capsule communicator talking directly to the to spacewalkers helping them, choreograph today's excursion.",886.9799800000001,906.6
"The tasks for all four spacewalks, in the communications, to Parmitano and Morgan outside of the International Space Station, falls into the hands of Canadian Space Agency astronaut, Jeremy Hansen.",907.7149999999999,920.31
You'll see more of him on console as the day wears on.,920.61,923.66998
"Hanson, trained extensively on all of the work associated with the alpha magnetic spectrometer, along with Chris Cassidy, the veteran NASA astronaut, who was recently assigned to fly on a Soyuz vehicle, back for another long duration mission to the International Space Station next April.",924.355,941.165
"I sat down recently with Chris Cassidy to talk about several items related to the alpha magnetic spectrometer spacewalks, one of which, he discussed the complexity of the tasks at hand.",941.865,954.05002
Very complex.,957.005,957.905
"Hubble, space walks were analogous in their complexity.",957.9649999999999,962.625
"You know, there's there's probably some arm goes going back and forth, about which one is more complex.",962.7649799999999,967.46
"I'll say out of that argument, but nonetheless, really, really super challenging.",967.46,971.38
"The way I like to describe it, Rob, to people, is Imagine you have your minivan, and you have to replace the fluid the fuel pump line, which is in the minivan underneath the second row seat to get there in your ski parka and ski gloves, you have to take off the back hatch, you have to remove the back seat, pull up the carpet, and the paneling, Now get to the fuel line, cut the fuel line in eight places, and then build everything back up and hope that there's no leak when you do it.",971.38,1003.8
"And and, all of this in the vacuum space in microgravity and with the space suit on, It's just that does a way in a in a way that describes the complexity, but that's just scratching the surface on some of the technical challenges this team has had putting these together.",1003.8,1020.6800000000001
"Veteran astronaut Chris Cassidy who was instrumental in the initial design of many of the techniques as well as the tools that will be employed during, the four spacewalks, the minimum of four spacewalks that will be required for the alpha magnetic spectrometer repairs that get underway a short time from now.",1022.81998,1041.73
The key word for all of this is expect the unexpected.,1042.21,1045.1100000000001
"We're walking, into uncharted territory with some of the work involved, the invasive surgery, to repair.",1045.905,1052.965
"To cut tubes and to splice together, lines, cooling lines, for the new pump module package, that will be used to revive the cooling system of the alpha magnetic spectrometer later on in the series of spacewalks.",1053.26,1068.155
"Some twenty plus newly designed, specially designed tools will be used during the space walks themselves.",1068.85498,1075.72998
"One of the items you'll be hearing about today is, a debris shield handling aid that will be installed by Parmitano and Morgan on the debris shield that bears the logo on the alpha magnetic spectrometer itself to provide the crew interface for the removal, the temporary stowage and the jettisoning of this debris shield.",1076.27,1094.955
We'll talk more about the jettisoning of objects in just a moment.,1094.955,1098.495
"Also, one of the unique tools involved is a wire tie cutting tool A team of community college students from Lone Star College Syfair here in Houston designed a zip tie cutter that can cut and retain zip ties during, today's spacewalk late in the space walk, and at the beginning of the second space walk, one week from today.",1098.875,1118.705
"The Johnson Space Center's space Tools Group and the engineering director had modified that tool for flight, and it's now, going to be used during, the first two space walks in support of the repair of the alpha magnetic spectrometer.",1119.24506,1132.57495
"This tool design was first tested in the neutral buoyancy lab, the big pool here at the Johnson space center, by divers using micro gene next testing and then on to other testing by astronaut Chris Cassidy during, the variety of the tool testing that has gone on in support of today's activities.",1133.1950000000002,1152.105
So students have been directly involved in that.,1152.40497,1154.78
"Let's hear a little bit more about this unique tool designed by the students, from Chris Cassidy himself.",1154.78,1160.4
Think this was prototype number one that I'm holding in my hands right now.,1162.175,1165.71497
"And it might be challenging to see, but there's a little groove down there, and you push the plunger and a guillotine chops the, the zip tie.",1165.855,1177.0400399999999
And this was this was good for a first take.,1177.0400399999999,1179.38
But then the the force is purely on your thumb.,1179.71497,1183.095
"And in some cases, it was challenging to kind of push through a particularly tough zip tie.",1183.15497,1188.6100000000001
"So we, said, hey, maybe you could get some more force or force assist actually in there.",1188.6100000000001,1194.13
And then what about when you cut it?,1194.13,1196.37
"Now If your thumb slips off, you release it and the zip tie",1196.37,1200.0
Floats away.,1200.48,1201.38
So we thought maybe it'd be cool if you could capture somehow the zip tie and keep it.,1202.24,1206.64
"And so with those comments, We came back with, this is the, the final answer, which you, you, simply press this lever, which is a significant less force than what is being delivered to the zip tie.",1206.64,1224.23
"So you can really slam that guillotine down with air, and there's some mechanical advantages inside.",1224.23,1230.205
"And you'll notice if I don't know if you can see, but the, the guillotine is is fixed now in the down position.",1230.745,1238.7
So it cuts it and grips it.,1238.76,1241.485
And the tool now has the cut zip tie in it.,1241.625,1245.625
"We can take this tool and put the whole the whole end of the tool into a trash bag and push this button, which does two things that caught it for the next operation and also releases the guillotine and whiz bang.",1245.625,1260.055
The zip tie is now in the trash bag.,1260.195,1262.114998
"Just a simple tool elegant in its simplicity and super, super useful beyond AMS.",1262.114998,1268.01
This is gonna be a nice tool for us in the rest of the space station.,1268.01,1270.99
But testimony to youth and innovation and even coming up with this concept.,1271.515,1275.454994
Absolutely.,1275.515,1276.015
"You know, throw throw challenging problems to bright young kids, and you're gonna get some amazing solutions.",1276.155,1280.475
And this is one of many examples in our space program.,1280.475,1283.28
"Veteran astronaut Chris Cassidy talking, to us, suddenly about, This unique tool developed by, students, STEM students, involved in, the innovation, part of contributions to our nation's space program.",1285.659996,1303.86
"Here in Mission Control, you're looking at, flight director Jeff Radigan in the black shirt.",1304.16,1308.240005
"He will be presiding over the first two spacewalks, both today and a week from today.",1308.48,1314.40501
"He'll swap places with veteran flight director, Emily Nelson, will be seated next to Radigan once we get the the spacewalk underway, Nelson will be the lead flight director for the third and fourth spacewalks in this series with Radigan by her side.",1314.785,1329.975
"The complexity of the, quartet of spacewalks required a pair of flight directors although many of the other flight control positions will be, consistent throughout the course of the space walking activities over the next few weeks.",1330.43501,1344.95
"To Radigan's right as veteran astronaut, Mark Vandahai, who will be assisting, today on console.",1345.43501,1352.175
"Talking to the crew until they are ready to exit the Quest airlock and to his right is, Canadian Space Agency astronaut, Jeremy Hansen, as we mentioned, who will be the voice you will hear, choreographing today's spacewalk once Parmatino and Morgan move outside into the vacuum of space.",1352.6100000000001,1371.655
"The international space station is currently flying directly over Seattle, crossing the west coast of, the United States, moving from northwest to southeast, an orbit inclined fifty one point six degrees to either side of the equator.",1379.225,1393.15001

"He will be maneuvered inside the crew lock momentarily under the, guidance of Christina Cook and Jessica Mir.",1403.89499,1411.62999
"And once that occurs, the hatch to the crew lock will be closed, and we will get a go for the depressurization of the crew lock that will take it down from fourteen point seven pounds per square inch of pressure down to vacuum in a two step fashion as they halt the depressurization at about the five pound per square inch mark, to enable systems checks and voice checks with the space walking crew inside the crew lock to be conducted with mission control before that depressurization resumes down to vacuum.",1411.76999,1442.23
"This is Mission Control Houston, everything, proceeding right on the timeline for the start of today's spacewalk, a little a little bit more than an hour from now.",1673.9499799999999,1684.16498
"Again, Luca Parmitano and Drew Morgan are now inside the crew lock section of the Quest airlock with the assistance of Christina Cook and Jessica Mir, Soon, the hatch will be closed, separating the equipment lock section, which is the closest compartment, to this camera field of view from the crew lock, And, within just a few minutes, flight director, Jeff Ratigan, here in mission control, will pull his flight controllers to get a go for depressurization of the crew lock once that hatch is closed.",1684.94498,1717.825
"The spacewalks Today is at least a schedule for six and a half hours in duration, but, we fully expect that these spacewalks could stretch longer than that, all of them, Again, many of the tasks that have been intensely rehearsed over the course of the past several years by Morgan and Parmatano before they launched to the International Space Station back in July.",1720.7649999999999,1744.8
"And, with the teams, both here and in Europe, having worked extensively in the development of tools and techniques for the repair of the alpha magnetic spectrometer, all of these tasks, are well understood.",1745.3400000000001,1759.76

"It's clocking a six, and we're still picking up your WVS, which is good.",7220.19,7224.77
Okay.,7226.75,7227.25
Think the pitch is India India.,7239.41,7240.93
Is that right?,7240.93,7241.75
"India India, and then kilo twelve.",7242.285,7244.865
"My good friend, Marks, there.",7267.345,7268.9
Nextiva taught me that the technique works really well.,7268.9,7271.48
Alright.,7274.740005,7275.14001
I heard you Luca.,7275.14001,7292.765

"This is Mission Control Houston approaching the one hour mark into, today's initial spacewalk, the first of at least four To repair the alpha magnetic spectrometer, the International Space Station flying just to the southwest of San Diego, across, the far eastern Pacific Ocean, moving from northwest to southeast, a good view of Luca Parmatano, his booted feet, planted in a portable foot restraint at the end of the Canada and two robotic arm, which is under the control of Jessica Beard, inside the space station at the Destiny Laboratory workstation, maneuvering Parmitano, slowly but surely over to the starboard three worksite where the alpha magnetic spectrometer is located.",7386.76999,7428.995
The International Space Station will be entering an orbital sunrise momentarily.,7435.28,7439.3
"K, Luke.",7450.7,7451.26
"And Drew, we're handing over in twenty seconds.",7451.26,7453.68

Yeah.,7571.84998,7572.33
"So I I've not seen this where it's black on black, but just in soft dock.",7572.33,7577.63
And now I'm trying to go white on black to unlock it.,7577.84998,7581.55502

"It, doesn't want it's just doesn't the car doesn't want the white on black position from here for some reason.",7582.27502,7589.77
It went very easily when I picked it up.,7591.67,7593.85
"Oh, there we go.",7595.11002,7596.065
I locked up the rep.,7599.025,7599.905

"It was just the, thing to call her back into the void on I so that I could release and try again.",7648.255,7655.59
"The clocking was off too, so it needed to adjust it.",7655.59,7658.55002
"But, we are clocking at six Okay.",7658.55002,7661.97498
Those are all good words.,7661.97498,7663.255

"Luca, I hope you get a lot of pictures of that.",7755.36,7757.78
I'm I'm currently up up straight down and facing the way.,7758.32,7762.82
Each I I sticking at the mood.,7763.52,7765.51495
That's a good shot.,7767.01495,7768.235
I'm I'm a nice to Cameron speaking at you.,7769.89496,7772.075
I'm excited I don't think I don't think he knows how to walk something.,7772.375,7778.60004
"And, Luca, we are ready to go, you'll be coming station aft to the AMS common position.",7787.14496,7792.5
We're still in course in about three minutes.,7792.5,7794.4400000000005

"We this am right next to where I'm setting up, there's a, there's a bar there.",7973.34499,7979.18999
Wondering if that's acceptable for translation.,7980.53,7982.84499
I don't know if you could see them at WVS.,7982.98499,7984.685
Yeah.,7985.70499,7986.105
We have a good view.,7986.105,7987.14499

K.,8108.735,8109.235
Copy.,8109.535,8110.035

I think you did your hope you're doing the view because I cannot really explain to you.,8132.41998,8137.785
Listening.,8143.75,8144.25
Turn my way.,8145.03,8145.93
"Oh, I can't.",8146.23,8147.21
My face is turning your way.,8148.07,8149.77
That's what that matters.,8149.91,8151.14
It's a camera dual.,8155.425,8156.88498
"And, Luca, we're in position hold.",8162.19998,8163.96
We're getting ready for the next Ocast.,8163.96,8166.37997
"And, Drew, I see you've got that APFR set up and you're kinda staged behind it.",8171.265,8175.42502
So I'm gonna jump ahead and just remind you for the day about that grapple fixture for the first time you get in.,8175.42502,8181.2
Okay.,8182.78,8183.28
"Where it is, if I see it, it's gonna be just like as models right at my left side.",8185.035,8193.435

So you guys are getting into position.,8205.685,8207.225
"First one is avoiding contact with capture with capture fingers of the fastener capture tools at the sharp edge, and then a caution for you.",8208.085,8218.62
"Reminder that you're not gonna impart loads on both the AMS and ELC, while the other crew member is imparting loads.",8219.055,8226.19498
Roger.,8228.38,8228.88
Roger.,8229.1,8229.6

I think it's gonna work well.,8253.265,8255.045
Motion.,8255.74503,8256.24503
Copy continuing.,8257.02502,8258.005
"Sounds good, Drew.",8259.38,8260.6
And have you opened it up yet?,8260.82,8262.52
On this.,8266.075,8266.815
"And if when we open that bag, it's gonna make a big mess, so I'd prefer not to get Okay.",8266.95502,8272.815
Sounds good?,8273.035,8273.93
Maybe my first view of my target area.,8278.16998,8280.83
Anything unexpected?,8290.78,8291.76
"Well, k.",8294.06,8296.54
Yeah.,8296.54,8296.78
I have a good view of the thirty day see all the I see the passengers on the ITA.,8296.78,8304.975
The six passengers on the the animal beam.,8306.075,8313.39
"And Drew, we would like you to maintain clearance for Luca and AMS.",8316.235,8320.65497
Copy that.,8321.195,8322.095
"Alright, Luca.",8322.15497,8323.055

Alright.,8334.14496,8334.625
Same right.,8334.625,8335.345
Look look at lean forward just a little bit.,8335.345,8337.52496
"Like, when we modeled, in the VR session, you do look closer at the ELC than it's than we originally thought.",8337.90497,8347.47003
So can't be forward and then go back to your neutral position.,8347.93,8355.755
And let me see how well you're splitting the difference.,8355.755,8358.89996
"Now you're about halfway in between, and I got a good view of the arm to the APFR, the WIP extender, and Luca to AMS.",8361.44,8372.20496
"And, Jessica, when I am on the APFR out of the APFR hanging on to it, I can see the board side trunnion pin too.",8372.56,8382.705
"I'll be able to get clearance for you that, on that to the tip lead.",8382.705,8386.565

Okay.,8396.715,8397.215
"Be another, it will be Lucas's Place to, my APFR as well.",8400.0,8404.88
He's probably less than a meter from my APFR as well.,8404.88,8409.38
We copy.,8409.8949995,8410.615
"You can help us out with that, Claire.",8410.615,8412.054999

"Yours is to confirm we to have one, okay.",8425.59,8429.005001
"Hi, Luca.",8436.31,8436.79
We are finished with those Ocases for now.,8436.79,8438.63
I'm about to start a manual maneuver.,8438.63,8441.190002
We've just gotten set up for that.,8441.190002,8442.71
"It's going to move you station forward, so you'll be going close sir to AMS about a meter.",8442.71,8448.074997
Copy.,8448.295,8448.795
You ready for motion?,8449.254997,8450.214996
I'm ready for motion.,8450.214996,8451.355
Okay.,8451.815,8452.214996
Here comes motion.,8452.214996,8453.274998
Yeah.,8467.205,8467.284996
"I see the good washer towards the full world of speed station motion, stop motion, stop motion, In motion.",8467.284996,8474.25
Okay.,8475.19,8475.69
I'm gonna need to y'all have a boot plate out of the way here.,8476.79,8479.59
It's very close to Lucas's place.,8479.59,8481.27
"Luca, give me a little lean forward leaning forward.",8481.27,8484.175
Okay.,8489.595,8489.915
"I'm gonna put a little bit of, John, and I'll be out of configuration.",8489.915,8495.07001
I could just roll it away.,8495.37,8496.83
Okay.,8517.58,8518.06
We're at we're outside of centimeters now of your plan to your place.,8518.06,8521.94501
"Keep just a little bit of lean forward in, Luca.",8521.94501,8524.205
"And, the this is as forward as I can we do need insurance.",8524.425,8528.58

"Like, Jessica, we've got we're about, at forty centimeters, the bottom of the saver to my APFR.",8530.87999,8538.705
"I've got a yacht enrolled away, and I've got good, visibility.",8538.845,8543.345
"That looks like the closest concern right now is my APFR, and I'm you can see it very clearly.",8543.405,8550.34001
"Do we copy, Drew?",8550.64001,8551.52
"So please continue to monitor those, and we have the other clearance concern for the arm in our view.",8551.52,8556.605
So you can focus on Luca.,8556.605,8558.06499
We have about thirty five centimeters to go coming station forward to get Luca to the next position.,8558.125,8563.34499
"K copies, then I anticipate that this is going to continue to bring him very close to the HFR boot plate.",8563.67001,8570.09001
"We'll go ahead with those, those final thirty five centimeters.",8572.415,8575.555
Okay.,8576.33499,8576.655

Ready for motion.,8694.11502,8695.095
It's improving.,8703.59,8704.25
Online.,8704.55,8705.05
Good motion.,8705.11,8705.85
Continuing.,8706.38998,8706.88998
"Can I have, ice cream, my own body, Durayu?",8707.43,8710.25
You have that Royu plan?,8724.87,8726.25
I have the Royu plan.,8726.39,8727.85
It check out any workstation to Okay.,8729.03,8731.405
Please stop motion.,8731.405,8732.385
K.,8732.685,8732.925
"Leave stop motion, and that's your published.",8732.925,8734.785
Perfect.,8735.405,8735.905
Wow.,8736.205,8736.705
K.,8738.81998,8739.31998
It's first thing you're gonna do.,8741.86,8743.62
I'm going to drop the bag over here on the right so that I can get closer.,8743.62,8749.465
"Okay, Luca.",8752.725,8753.625
"And then your first task, once you're in the right location is the vacuum case Or or, sorry, the, the handling aid for the debris shield?",8755.4,8765.285
The debris shield handling aid copy.,8767.025,8768.965
We went back in in the end kilo twelve.,8799.715,8802.35
"Okay, Drew.",8804.89,8805.61002
How's it look to you?,8805.61002,8806.75
"Gonna, extend the ingress aid and take a look at how we will be at.",8810.315,8818.55
"One hour eighteen minutes into the space walk of view, from Luca Parmatano's helmet camera looking into the tool bag, that he has outside of, the international space station with him, and the variety of, unique tools that are being employed in the repair of the alpha magnetic spectrometer.",8821.09,8838.63
"In this case, tools specific to the removal of, the debris shield that covering, the internal plumbing and electronics of the cosmic ray detector.",8838.69,8849.48502
"Can I take me a couple of minutes, sir, up to you?",8850.74503,8853.79
Hey.,8854.27002,8854.51
We copy and concur.,8854.51,8855.87
"For our discussions, we will leave the brakes off for now.",8855.87,8860.11002
"But if you in anticipate that you're going to impart any motion, then let us know.",8860.11002,8864.495
We can put the brakes on.,8864.495,8865.955
No.,8866.415,8866.655
I don't expect.,8866.655,8867.475
"And, Okay.",8867.695,8869.91
Let me let me do a quick assessment here.,8869.91,8872.23
"If I installed the aggregate right now, it's going to be need to leave me a little, but it forced me to stay a little further away.",8872.23,8881.45502
"At this point, I would rather changed the order with, and, the first is first at least.",8882.39502,8889.23
"I was gonna try and release maybe to call that nurse doctor, and then they installed bag with gate valve to our Yeah.",8894.97498,8904.71
"We we do put the, the a a f plug in after we remove that first fastener.",8904.71,8910.725
So and that kinda needs the handling aid.,8911.505,8914.485
It does.,8916.01,8916.65
Okay.,8916.65,8917.15
Let me let me spell that again.,8917.29,8919.23
"We when do you think, be the best time to work in that trip to the green bag?",8924.035,8928.77496
If our position looks great.,8929.235,8930.57
That's gonna be predicted.,8932.01,8933.23
"Do you as a reminder, we will want you for clearance we do start GCA.",8937.29,8940.845
"And that's basically the question we're asking down here is if Luca thinks he's gonna need another GCA shortly, stuff to him whether otherwise this is a good window to go get the green bag.",8942.745,8952.20996
"If you can work here for a bit, Luca.",8952.20996,8954.14996
I'm holding the head again right now.,8957.565,8963.16504
So after I installed this I'm I'm I'm good to for the next GCA.,8963.16504,8969.56
Okay.,8972.02,8972.5
"Sounds like hold tight, Drew.",8972.5,8974.04004
"And, and then once Luca's confirmed his final position, then we'll go get that bag.",8974.10004,8979.175
Gotcha.,8980.83496,8981.33496
"And a reminder, Luca, if you do want more stiffness in the and bring some brief on for that as well.",8983.07495,8988.06
"Nice job, Luca.",9020.67,9021.47
That looks good.,9021.47,9022.529999

Right roll.,9050.07,9050.79
"And then I need once once again, I'll repeat the right roll.",9050.79,9054.41
"I need it towards, Well, I currently need you can give me two heads off the bed.",9054.79,9067.58
I'll take that.,9067.58,9068.56
"K, Luca.",9069.1,9069.58
That was a little bit garbled.,9069.58,9070.78
The first thing we heard was that you wanted right to roll.,9070.78,9073.68
And then I believe the second thing would be head up.,9073.755,9076.075
We're gonna take those one at a time.,9076.075,9078.015
Those are both correct.,9079.354996,9080.735

"And, and I'll keep an eye on mine since, right now, I've moved it back to its normal configuration, but, his paper as well above the boot plate.",9160.595,9171.47
So we'll keep an eye on that.,9171.47,9173.25
"And then Jessica, the, the matter of fact, If it makes it easier or better, I could use pure special and forward right now, and they would achieve the same result.",9173.39001,9188.73
Give me that.,9189.27,9190.17
Okay.,9190.71,9191.03

Let's get to a few of them while we have a moment here.,14070.82498,14073.38498
The first one What's the time line looks like?,14073.38498,14076.88
"During a spacewalk, how long does depressurization last before the hatch is open?",14077.2,14081.36002
"This, refers to when the crew is in the crew lock section of the Quest airlock But the hatch closed to the rest of the interior of the International Space Station, the depressurization typically weeks, about thirty five minutes or so in a two step fashion from fourteen point seven pounds per square inch of pressure down to five pounds psI.",14081.36002,14102.335
"And then, after a brief check of suit systems and communications gear, The depressurization resumes down to vacuum before the hatch is open to set the stage for the, suits being placed on internal battery power to mark the official start of a spacewalk.",14103.03497,14119.705

The Canadaarm two has been indispensable since its installation at the International Space Station on the SDS one hundred mission in two thousand one.,14156.915,14165.88
"And, for the final set of questions that we're, responding to at the moment, will the debris shield that was just jettisoned, head back to earth and burn up in the atmosphere?",14175.9,14184.94
"The answer is yes, ultimately, difficult to say exactly when the debris shield has dimensions of fifty inches By twenty five inches, by seven and a half inches, it only has a mass of twenty pounds, so it will be captured by, the slight tug of gravity in the lower earth atmosphere and will burn up in the earth's atmosphere at a point, in the not too distant future.",14184.94,14209.41498

You'll get clear instead of acting case while during the actual q series.,17063.33502,17068.37
That's twenty.,17081.55,17082.37
"And you were cut off there, Luca.",17088.235,17089.51498
Was that good?,17089.51498,17090.415
We've called the stop motion.,17091.035,17092.655
"And, I would rather have the brakes off for for now.",17093.275,17097.615
And I'll send this for any more rigidity.,17097.82,17099.6
Okay.,17100.38,17100.7

"I agree with you, Luca, that That's the VSP there.",17137.87,17140.855
I hear you're touching.,17140.855,17141.755
"Oh, yeah.",17143.89502,17144.375
Definitely.,17144.375,17144.855
The VSP.,17144.855,17145.435
Sorry.,17145.575,17145.815
"Before those ones, Luca, rather than you dealing with, getting those ones off, you're there.",17145.815,17155.19
Do you wanna use some out of the Wi Fi caddy?,17155.19,17157.69
We do that acceptable?,17158.095,17159.075
Yeah.,17161.535,17161.855
It's acceptable.,17161.855,17162.67502
"So, Luca, for these, maybe the next one will use one.",17173.395,17177.495
We're just doing two of them.,17178.355,17179.975
One Venus one nadir.,17180.675,17182.215
And you're just loosely putting them on there.,17182.55002,17185.43002
"So three twists, but just near the top is fine.",17185.43002,17188.09003
"Drew, can I get a glove and half check from you?",17203.22,17205.56
"Drew, can we get a glove and half check from you when you're ready?",17255.85,17258.91
Yep.,17262.175,17262.335
"I at the time you called for Lucas, I checked mine.",17262.335,17265.63498
"There's a that outer, you know, RTV left pinky finger, the more, additional patch that's just waiting to elevate much like I've seen in the past on these gloves.",17266.895,17280.105
There's intact RTV underneath it.,17280.245,17282.345
Now it's dry.,17283.365,17284.265
Okay.,17285.2,17285.7
"We copy, and we could see it in your WVS.",17285.76,17288.1
K.,17295.57498,17295.815
So you will like one of the the ones in here.,17295.815,17298.85498
I'll kick you Hi.,17298.85498,17316.92
You have a red?,17317.95996,17318.94
Yeah.,17320.12,17320.36
Could you use the transfer red?,17320.36,17321.82
Can I have your red?,17324.92,17326.13995
A long wire time from it looks like four.,17337.29,17341.87
It Pierce.,17344.88995,17345.865
It was easier to get off.,17364.695,17366.475
"Definitely, like, to get him off",17367.65497,17369.24
"Drew, next thing we need is the lancer.",17405.52,17407.62
I'll be answers available.,17411.245,17412.625
Alright.,17417.12,17417.36
The next thing you can start getting ready for Drew is a inventory of crew lock bag one.,17417.36,17422.080002
We're no rush.,17422.080002,17423.140001
Lancer is here on the transfer list.,17434.39,17443.745
You can leave it on transfer.,17444.864998,17446.065
"Right, you want.",17446.065,17446.965
Thank you.,17447.024998,17447.844997
"Okay, Luca.",17450.065,17450.885
"We are, we're cutting lacing cord now.",17451.13,17453.77
"Reminder, we wanna avoid cutting, actually cutting the MLI itself if we can.",17453.77,17458.91
Get the lacing cord off the hook in the trash bag.,17481.034996,17483.755
I'm gonna start at do lock the battery with weed here.,17483.755,17487.375
You do me my cut also the MLi in the middle.,17487.97,17500.905
Sorry.,17502.085,17502.325
They're looking for the middle of the MLi.,17502.325,17504.265
"Sir, you're talking about lacing cords in the middle, Luca?",17507.11,17509.53
"This is Mission Control Houston, three hours forty three minutes into today's spacewalk.",17509.59,17513.85
"Luca Parmatano and, Drew Morgan, currently preparing to cut away, a series of, points where thermal insulation is covering the vertical support beam on the alpha magnetic spectrometer Underneath which are the delicate stainless steel cooling tubes that they will cut and splice together And the bypass surgery required to install a new cooling pump on the third spacewalk in the series, coming up, in the days ahead.",17514.425,17544.34
"One of the, tools being used in support of this activity is a zip tie cutter that was designed by students.",17545.285,17554.47
"That sounds good, Drew.",17554.84999,17556.04999
"Associated with, the micro g next project representing Lone Star College SIFare here in Houston.",17556.04999,17564.405
"They, designed an, a tool, that was modified by the spacewalk engineering community here at the Johnson Space Center.",17564.86499,17572.12
"Veteran astronaut Chris Cassidy sat down with us, recently.",17572.42,17576.28
"To discuss, how innovative this particular tool is in support of the alpha magnetic spectrometer repair effort.",17576.825,17583.805
Think this was prototype number one that I'm holding in my hands right now.,17585.09,17588.62999
"And it might be challenging to see, but there's a little groove down there, and you push the plunger and a guillotine chops the, the zip tie.",17588.76999,17599.93001
"And this was this was good for a first take, but then the the force is purely on your thumb.",17599.93001,17605.87
"And in some cases, it was challenging to kinda push through a particularly tough zip tie.",17606.09,17611.515
"So we, said, hey, maybe you could get some more force or force assist actually in there.",17611.515,17617.05501
And then What about when you cut it?,17617.115,17619.34001
"Now if your thumb slips off, you release it, and the zip tie floats away, So we thought maybe it'd be cool if you could capture somehow the zip tie and keep it.",17619.34001,17629.605
"And so with those comments, We came back with, this is a the the final answer, which you you simply press this lever, which is a significant less force than what is being delivered to the zip tie.",17629.605,17647.095
"So you can really slam that guillotine down with air, and there's some mechanical advantages inside.",17647.095,17653.06999
"And you'll notice if I don't know if you can see, but the, the guillotine is is fixed now in the down position.",17653.61,17661.55502
So it cuts it and grips it.,17661.695,17664.34
And the tool now has the cut zip tie in it.,17664.56,17668.56
"We can take this tool and put the whole the whole end of the tool into a trash bag and push this button, which does two things that it for the next operation and also releases the guillotine and whiz bang.",17668.56,17682.97
The zip tie is now in the trash bag.,17683.03,17685.03
"Just a simple tool elegant in its simplicity and super, super useful beyond AMS.",17685.03,17690.895
This is gonna be a nice tool for us in the restless base station.,17690.895,17693.875
But testimony to youth and innovation and even coming up with this concept.,17694.43,17698.37
Absolutely.,17698.43,17698.93
"You know, throw throw challenging problems to bright young kids, and you're gonna get some amazing Solutions, and this is just one of many examples in our space program.",17698.99,17706.185
"Veteran astronaut Chris Cassidy, recently discussing with us, some of the aspects of the alpha magnetic spectrometer repair effort in this particular instance, one of the, twenty plus, tools specially designed for the AMS repair effort itself.",17708.565,17724.51498
Three hours forty six minutes into the space walk.,17725.935,17728.41498
"This view from Luca parmitano helmet camera as he continues, to pull back thermal insulation, covering the vertical support beam This is, essentially, a long, rectangular structure that, covers the cooling tubes that he and Drew Morgan will be cutting and splicing together as part of the, bypass repair work coming up on subsequent spacewalks associated with the alpha magnetic spectrometer repair.",17728.41498,17756.505
"In the knob to the blue tool, And then around two, the ten o'clock position, I've got an adjustable with the pin on it.",17758.725,17768.055
EF flux ritter.,17769.655,17770.955
"And, anything everything sounds good there.",17771.735,17776.475
"K, Drew.",17783.855,17784.33502
That all sounded good.,17784.33502,17785.55502
We we thought we heard one extra adjustable.,17785.77502,17788.035
We're just talking about that.,17788.095,17789.635
So there are were you I have three address cables in here.,17794.47998,17800.005
Two or Yeah.,17802.54498,17804.145
Just so I'll be there.,17804.145,17805.425

We're good.,17807.10498,17807.66498
Three is right.,17807.66498,17808.645
K.,17810.34,17810.84
So we're good on that bag.,17813.54,17814.74002
I'll fill it up and we'll call it good.,17814.74002,17817.0
"We're good on that bag, Drew.",17817.83502,17819.61502
"Just a reminder, we will open it back up one more time just to put a trash bag in at the end.",17824.34998,17828.91
"But for now, that's the complete inventory.",17828.91,17830.93
Copy.,17833.845,17834.345
"That's the trash bag that's on the, back in case handrail.",17838.485,17841.625
"That's the Next tool we're gonna need is the zip tie cutter, Drew.",17844.18997,17856.83502
Copy.,17858.255,17858.655
It's available.,17858.655,17859.315
It is.,17879.35,17880.01

"Warning as you get in there, Luca is to avoid contact with the back of the IPA and the VSB for the sharp edges on the nut plates, and then as well as cut zip ties when we get there.",17883.51,17895.565
So what do you think on the answer?,17899.08,17900.44
You're gonna need it anymore?,17900.44,17901.66
Yeah.,17905.75497,17906.155

"So, Luca, on the procedure, there was one piece of lacing cord possibly behind the TTCB.",17921.17,17927.855
So you might wanna give that consideration.,17928.95496,17930.735
That's been that's your right side.,17931.91,17933.85
"So if that flap's not opening as much as you want, that could be what's going on there.",17934.39,17939.13
Yeah.,17940.015,17940.495
Being there somewhere.,17940.495,17941.475

K.,18170.28,18170.44
In the process of transferring those tools over Copy.,18170.44,18175.355
Take your time.,18175.575,18176.555
"Hey, Luca.",18208.99501,18209.735
Just talk to us about the IPA and those sharp edges on the back of it.,18209.79501,18213.71501
"We think, the way your hand is, the way you're grabbing it looks perfectly fine, but we just wanna make sure we're all on the same page.",18213.71501,18221.14
"There are some sharp edges either further down, or if you curl your fingers up in there, And so I just wanted to remind you about it.",18221.14,18228.47499

Is that three times?,18584.125,18585.26495
I have enough slack So it'll take me a couple of minutes to have everything behind the VSB cover.,18585.725,18594.0
Excellent.,18597.575,18598.075
Luca.,18598.29504,18598.79504

Okay.,18710.91,18711.41
Okay.,18717.935,18718.255
You said it's not gonna be an issue?,18718.255,18720.035
"I found it, and it's losing.",18723.659996,18725.36
It's floating underneath and behind.,18726.54,18728.96
Okay.,18730.655,18731.155
Good words.,18731.295,18732.03499
The one the one is an issue.,18734.25499,18736.11499
This one on the other end.,18737.135,18738.595
It's paid to make sure.,18739.76999,18741.06999
Okay.,18744.40999,18744.89
Yeah.,18744.89,18745.20999

"Is there something that, you guys agree?",18758.87999,18761.14
"But I can try and just capture those fasteners, just using the using the fastener without undoing the MLI.",18762.4,18772.655
That's all supposed to be Checking.,18772.655,18777.81999
"Okay, Luca.",18786.095,18786.915
So the shorter answer is yes.,18787.055,18788.575
We're okay with you cutting that.,18788.575,18790.06
But the risk is that the ribbon cable is up in that bundle as well.,18790.06,18794.7
So you're just gonna need to be really aware of the ribbon cable if you wanna cut more lacing board.,18794.7,18800.845
Let's try it out.,18800.845,18802.065
Try it out.,18802.845,18803.825
"I'm gonna break torque and try to talk behind a bit, and, the idea on the line, how's that sound?",18804.125,18810.76
Yeah.,18811.62,18812.02
We like that idea.,18812.02,18813.06

You're marked for the second of the two spacewalks that is planned one week from today.,18965.69,18970.59
"The first task, on this get ahead, block of work is the removal of the cover for the vertical support beam that you see Luca Parmatano working on right now on the alpha magnetic spectrometer, that vertical support beam cover is, the cover over the cooling tubes that will be cut and spliced together on a subsequent spacewalk, to set the stage of, basically, the bypass surgery, to accept the new pump module that was delivered on the, Northrop Grum and Cygnus cargo craft a few weeks ago.",18971.08502,19006.38498
"Well, we could use this, if You wanna use you can use The plan of attack today is, just to keep pressing on.",19007.72498,19015.87
Plenty of consumables.,19016.17,19017.23
The crew is in good shape.,19017.53,19018.81
"Their suits are working perfectly and to see how far we get in trying to mark time, as far ahead as we can as we move from one spacewalk to another in this series of complicated, excursions to repair the alpha magnetic spectrometer.",19018.81,19034.07
Okay.,19048.05002,19048.53
I'm ready.,19048.53,19050.31

"Reminder, Luca, that the VSP is tilted fifteen degrees aft when you're trying to align that gold bit.",19106.39502,19112.41504
Got it.,19114.13995,19114.69995
And how many turns do this this week?,19114.69995,19117.18
Please go faster than that?,19117.18,19118.95996
"So just bring This is mission control Houston as Luca Parmatano begins work on get ahead tasks, that were planned for the second spacewalk in this series a week from today just to get as far ahead of the game as possible.",19121.145,19134.5
"The crew in the process of removing the cover for the vertical support beam that, provides the shelter over the cooling tubes that will be cut and spliced for the alpha magnetic spectrometer in the support of the installation of the new upgraded thermal tracker cooling system that was delivered, to the station a few weeks ago.",19135.28,19157.645
"We are continuing to take some questions on, social media at the hashtag Ask NASA, the next in the series, how long does an average spacewalk last?",19157.645,19167.31
"Spaceewalks are generally budgeted for about six and a half hours in duration We often exceed that amount of time, but it's strictly based on, how the crew is feeling and the amount of consumables available in their space suits.",19167.37,19179.86
"That act, basically, as an enclosure, their own, internal spacecraft itself as they're operating in the void of space and weightlessness.",19180.1,19188.27997
"So six and a half hours is the baseline, but, there's no limit, up, To that point, as long as the consumables exist, the longest spacewalk in history was",19189.125,19200.0
"Conducted, years ago by Susan Helms and Jim Voss in eight hour fifty six minute space walk during an earlier space settle assembly flight to the International Space Station.",19200.0,19210.255
Yeah.,19210.875,19211.375
That's good news.,19211.514999,19212.415
"About an hour and a half ago, one of the first major tasks was completed the removal of a debris shield over the alpha magnetic spectrometer in its jettisoning by Drew Morgan, the next question that we have, Why is the debris shield not being reused?",19213.195,19228.565
The answer is it's no longer required.,19229.185001,19231.125
"It, will be replaced by thermal insulation.",19231.425001,19235.125
"At the end, of this series of spacewalks, but the debris shield is no longer, required because the new cooling pump package is being installed in a different location on the alpha magnetic spectrometer and, the The equipment that the debris shield was covering beforehand is being bypassed for a new, route for cooling tubes in that instrument to provide the proper cooling for the internal cosmic ray detector hardware so that debris shield is history and no longer are being required, for use in the operation of the alpha magnetic spectrometer.",19235.78,19273.3
Alright.,19334.77,19335.27
"Twelve, I'm still not broken.",19338.675,19341.335

"He's been sending a mask because the red This is Mission Control Houston, four and a half hours into, today's space walk by Luca Parmitano and Drew Morgan, the first of four.",20272.01,20280.915

"This view from, Parmitano's helmet camera, showing him continuing, to release the screws and fasteners holding the vertical support beam cover in place.",20286.23,20296.14502
"This is the the structure that, covers the cooling tubes, that provide the cooling capability for the, cosmic ray detector.",20296.765,20306.48
"It appears as if we're on a course, that will enable, this cover to be removed and jettisoned to join, the earlier sending of the debris shield on the alpha magnetic spectrometer that was cast away by Drew Morgan some two hours ago.",20307.63498,20323.13
Help me.,20323.335,20324.155
Yeah.,20324.29504,20324.695
Battery ends toward me.,20324.695,20326.635
K.,20327.815,20328.315
"And I have a rep to it, and I see your rep going back to you.",20328.695,20333.08
Reallycing your ret ret's coming back to you.,20333.24,20335.66003
"K, jump.",20336.04004,20336.78
Got it.,20337.08,20337.74
Okay.,20338.04004,20338.44
"Now, please remind me some currently, the vision being made is, attached to both the cover and maybe it still fit maybe it gives the itself.",20338.44,20353.29
Yeah.,20354.79,20355.02997
That's right.,20355.02997,20355.83
And the next thing you're gonna do is unlock the slide lock and then rotate the capture block up and then relock.,20355.83,20364.43506
Good stock.,20365.05505,20365.67
Okay.,20369.75,20370.14996
"Sorry, Luca.",20370.14996,20370.79
I missed that.,20370.79,20371.67
So you just need to kinda lift it up a little bit towards the top of your head as just caught on the lip of the VSP.,20371.67,20377.43506
Just kinda push it up towards the vacuum case.,20378.61505,20381.515
Yeah.,20383.27,20383.51
It looks like I'm gonna have to completely release it.,20383.51,20386.33
Yeah.,20391.625,20392.02496
"No, Luca.",20392.02496,20392.665
Just give us one second here.,20392.665,20394.265
"We we just wanna talk it through, but you shouldn't have to release the tool.",20394.265,20397.785
So and there is a lip.,20397.785,20399.165
So,20399.625,20400.0
It seems like to us that you just need to retract that capture block again and then lift it up.,20400.08,20408.66
"So the the motor part Degs, but can it came out?",20418.625,20424.47
"Okay, Luca.",20426.13,20426.895
"You have to, come up with something else here.",20432.175,20434.6
Okay.,20435.399998,20435.899998
Now I can probably pay with it.,20436.12,20438.76
And Now it starts from solving it.,20438.76,20450.375
"The vertical support beam cover plate that, Parmatino will be removing here a short time from now.",20474.32,20481.995
"It's a very small, rectangular object, twenty eight inches is long by four inches and weighs about one pound in mass.",20482.455,20491.17
"It, also, will be handed off to Drew Morgan to be jettisoned aft of the international a space station as the crew is now working on tasks originally earmarked for the second of the two spacewalks in support of the repair of the a magnetic spectrometer that second spacewalk scheduled one week from today.",20491.78999,20508.84
Alright.,20516.885,20517.284996
Looks like you got it.,20517.284996,20518.325
That's great.,20518.325,20518.805
Let's pay attention to the ribbon cable as we do this.,20518.805,20521.43
Hey.,20524.23,20524.55
"I'm three of the cable cables, and the ribbon cable is out these away.",20524.55,20530.17
Okay.,20530.55,20531.05
Alright.,20531.515,20531.99501
So a couple things to think about here.,20531.99501,20533.91501
"Once we break the VSP cover, we're gonna have sharp edges.",20533.91501,20536.955
That's an important warning.,20536.955,20538.335
We're avoiding the ribbon cables we talked about.,20539.18,20543.36
"And then when you're breaking the cover, we gotta make sure we're not putting any loads in.",20543.73999,20547.81999
I.,20547.81999,20548.06
E.,20548.06,20548.14
"Drew needs to be, still.",20548.14,20550.385
Yeah.,20553.72499,20554.045
Copy.,20554.045,20554.545
Alright.,20555.805,20556.305
"And And, Luca, can you just double check the slide lock is engaged again?",20556.44499,20560.0
Slide lock is engaged.,20562.22,20563.52
Okay.,20566.925,20567.325
That looks good.,20567.325,20568.285
Let me just check if we're gonna break this thing.,20568.285,20570.785
Am I do?,20576.48,20577.38
It's checking.,20578.24,20579.06
"You are go, Luca.",20579.52,20581.04001
You have a go to break the cover.,20581.04001,20582.74
Just as expected.,20612.28,20613.5
That looks wonderful.,20613.64,20614.70001
Okay.,20624.225,20624.725
"Let's transfer that over to Drew, and we'll get ready to jettison it.",20625.04001,20629.70001
"And the vertical support beam cover now removed in good shape by Parmatano, he'll hand it off to Drew Morgan for the second of the two jettisons planned, for the series of spacewalks, to repair the alpha magnetic spectrometer.",20630.64,20643.86
There you go.,20645.51999,20647.7
Alright.,20648.0,20648.31999
"I'm gonna I barely put a red on it, so we all get set.",20648.31999,20651.705
"And I have a red on it made, and I see the sharp edge.",20653.92499,20657.625
Keeping it away from both of us.,20658.25,20659.77
You're right.,20659.77,20660.16998
It's back to you.,20660.16998,20661.38998
I have handling aid in the VSP.,20662.16998,20666.19
Let me grab the camera.,20666.905,20668.26498
Yep.,20668.26498,20668.76498

"And let's just take a a pause here for a second, Drew.",20669.54498,20672.525
Let's verify the the handling aid.,20673.145,20677.47
So make sure the lever is perpendicular.,20677.53,20679.71
"Capture block's deployed, and the slide is locked.",20680.65,20683.23
It's perpendicular and wide and locked.,20685.32498,20690.865
And we've got low factors.,20691.16498,20694.21
Okay.,20695.87,20696.35
That looks good.,20696.35,20697.41
"And, when you guys have your cameras ready, let us know.",20697.87,20701.41
"And, you are good to remove your ret, Drew.",20701.605,20704.345

"And, just like you've got it sail into the wind, that's the right orientation.",20726.4,20730.34
We see you holding it in right there.,20730.4,20731.75998
You have a go for Jettison.,20731.75998,20733.13998

Another great pitch.,20755.025,20755.985
"Good job, Drew.",20755.985,20757.04498
Let's get a glove and half check when you guys are done taking video and photos.,20759.185,20763.44498
"The vertical support beam cover now is cast away by Drew Morgan, the second of the two jettisons in the spacewalk ten sixteen AM central time.",20764.37,20772.55002

Okay.,20840.075,20840.55502
"Gentlemen, things are going very well.",20840.55502,20842.875
We're four hours thirty nine minutes in.,20842.875,20845.375
Consumables are still great.,20845.83502,20847.45502
So we think we have enough time.,20847.87,20849.55
"Well, we do have enough time to go ahead with the VSP spacer removal.",20849.55,20853.38998

I think I think I'll be good from here.,20886.655,20891.155
Okay.,20893.695,20894.17502
That sounds good.,20894.17502,20895.155
"Drew, once you're back in APFR, we'll be going for the green bit.",20896.03,20899.65

"This will provide additional, leverage and access to the cooling tubes eight stainless steel cooling tubes that lie underneath, that, component on the alpha magnetic spectrometer.",20959.275,20970.7
"For today, and then we'll be cleaning up and heading back in.",20971.255,20973.495
Does that work for you?,20973.495,20974.715
Do what you think?,20977.895,20979.03503
"I will work as far as long as the team feels comfortable and I have Hi, brother.",20981.75,20987.665

I'll I'll just wait for the cable and then release it from the bag.,22967.41501,22971.035
"The way, so it will be a little more viable.",22971.83,22974.17
And then there you go.,22975.59,22979.37

Yeah.,23010.84999,23011.17
"So the first step is actually to take the wire tie and put it on the row u cable around the row u cable, and then we'll put this bundle into that wire tie.",23011.17,23022.08
Okay.,23026.56,23027.06

Zenith side.,23090.96997,23092.18997
"So looking at the at at the handle, you know, the handle on the RaiU, there's a loop of cable and I can go there if you guys like that plan.",23095.86502,23107.49
Yep.,23111.15,23111.47
"That's a good plan, Luca.",23111.47,23112.85

Look look at this and try to imagine the mag and the CTTS in this cable here.,23218.82498,23225.93
Fortunately.,23229.77,23230.27
Let me see.,23232.88998,23233.53
"Actually, if you lean back or off the over your left side, I think.",23233.53,23237.45502
And now I'm doing like this.,23238.635,23240.255
And I'm moving more.,23242.23502,23243.375
"And just one thing to consider, Luca, is this is the last task we're doing today when we come back out on the DVA, we're gonna do the power cables, and then they're gonna go in with this bundle as well.",23244.16998,23255.20502
So we will have another opportunity to straighten this stuff up.,23255.345,23258.645
Let's see.,23261.05002,23261.61002

"And, let's make sure we got everything we need to there.",23311.09,23314.47
"We're happy with, changing things up a little bit.",23315.33,23318.325
"For example, the trash bag that we gotta bring in can go into crew lock bag four, with the other stuff you put in there if you prefer or we can put it in crew lock bag one.",23318.325,23327.86
We won't have to open it up again.,23327.86,23329.56
Yeah.,23332.1,23332.42
"I think it might fit in crew lock bag one a little bit better So, Luca, I'm gonna hand you if you wanna give me your BRT ret and I'm gonna hand you, give you control a crew lock bag one.",23332.42,23344.485
Yeah.,23344.485,23344.725
Do I have to camera there.,23344.725,23346.25
"Cameron is, I can show it on bag.",23346.70996,23350.06995
Perfect.,23350.06995,23350.56995
Just give me a second.,23351.26996,23352.49
I'm gonna type everything up.,23353.43,23354.915
Use my rent for the VRC.,23373.965,23375.905
"Your bag is, effectively, inventory messing on I mean, Tammy, you're at Yeah.",23377.645,23382.71
Just put them on our viewings.,23382.71,23384.41003

"And this one is inventory, but the only thing we're gonna have to do this point is the, the trash bag.",23385.51,23391.73505
Okay.,23392.35504,23392.67505
We're not putting in there.,23392.67505,23393.675
Okay.,23395.27496,23395.77496
I think weed is ready for us to do that.,23396.955,23399.375
"Hey, firm.",23401.5999999,23402.34
So we don't need to inventory crew lock bag one.,23402.3999999,23404.56
"We're just gonna carefully add the trash bag I'm gonna have the trash bag and the the RET needs to go with it, Leekah.",23404.56,23412.955
K.,23414.375,23414.695
So you've used the RET can use this one and go on the outside right there and release it and release the bag if you can release the or I can read the red tube.,23414.695,23426.325
That's correct.,23426.405,23427.045
It'll go go with it.,23427.045,23428.665
"And you can put that, to the inside of the bag.",23429.205,23432.805
Yes.,23432.805,23433.045002

Copy.,23450.48,23450.98
"Luca, we won't have a lot of other stuff here for you, but maybe a a bit of a site survey with the camera might be useful for us before you leave the work site.",23476.265,23485.0
Absolutely.,23487.46,23487.96
Send me You grabbed the camera from the from that light from the bag.,23488.020004,23493.685

"While while you're there, let's inventory crew lock bag too.",23545.42,23548.23999
K.,23574.885,23575.385
We've got crew lock back to orient with the handle up.,23575.685,23579.2
On the exterior.,23579.44,23580.34
A small small.,23582.31999,23583.45999
"That's, all I'm tracking on the exterior.",23587.385,23589.56499
It's concerning Okay.,23590.58499,23592.025
So we're following along.,23592.025,23593.245
I have here we go.,23598.82999,23602.29
That is attached to an adjustable on either end of this adjustable are the lancer in the diagonal cutter.,23603.985,23611.36499
"And, the one immediately adjacent to its done next class position over as an integral to an adjustable and we've got the the vice grip on one end and a empty hook on the other.",23612.87,23631.74
And working away around.,23635.545,23636.825
"The next thing I have is an empty interval ret, and then, for the next interval ret I have, socket caddy with the red, gold, and green bit on it.",23636.825,23647.59999
"And then over on the left side, to the nine ten o'clock position.",23648.94,23653.66501

Okay.,23658.81998,23659.22
"That's a good inventory, Drew.",23659.22,23661.62
So you can pack that one up.,23661.62,23662.97998
We're done with two.,23662.97998,23664.03998
Okay.,23665.46,23665.96
K.,23670.88498,23671.125

You got it.,23676.36002,23677.18002
This is Mission Control Houston at the five hour twenty six minute mark into today's initial spacewalk and a quartet of excursions for Aluka Parmatano and Drew Morgan planned for the repair of the alpha magnetic spectrometer.,23690.37,23704.225
"Not only, did Parmitano and Morton complete all of the work associated with this first space walk, they pressed ahead.",23705.76,23712.74
"And, in very efficient fashion, completed, a number of tasks that were on the docket for the second spacewalk scheduled for one week from today, including the removal of the vertical support beam cover that, essentially houses the eight stainless steel cooling tubes that will be cut and spliced together in preparation for the acceptance of the next upgraded, thermal tracker pump that will, restore full cooling to the alpha magnetic spectrometer.",23713.17502,23744.97
"They jettisoned its cover, removed some spacer devices and, connected a data cable originally planned for the second Spacewalk.",23745.11,23755.19998
So they're well ahead of the game here at this point and are in the process of conducting inventory of their tools and tethers as you look Drew Morgan from Luca Parmatano's helmet camera as they take pictures of one another in the home stretch of today's initial spacewalk.,23755.26,23769.525
That's good.,23773.08002,23773.82
Alright.,23776.36002,23776.86002
Gonna go back to my orientation for your bad touch.,23788.0,23793.78
"Hey, Luca.",23794.16,23794.72
The other thing we wanna do just since we're leaving this stuff out for a week is go back to those vacuum case handrails and just double check their black on black lock or the arrows are touching.,23794.72,23805.085
K.,23805.59,23805.83
"On my box, now come black, vacuum case, and they'll either these locks black or black your totals around.",23805.83,23820.515
"And the one On the diagonal beam, the three jaws are closed lot black or black with two vest and wiggle test.",23821.535,23835.155
Okay.,23840.095,23840.595
I think the next thing is to get Luca on his way back for the robotics.,23840.87,23845.29
One thing to consider is whether we're gonna have to move Drew's APFR again or not.,23845.75,23850.205
So I guess it depends on the back way.,23854.925,23857.16498
"If you just Luca, if we go straight towards your feet, here, I think we're gonna be just fine.",23857.16498,23863.91
"That that depends on, just and on the service options.",23863.97,23869.05502
"Hey, Jessica.",23877.46002,23878.02002
Are you with us?,23878.02002,23879.0
We are with you.,23881.78,23882.76
And if we were to go towards Luca's feet to clear him from AMS.,23882.98,23887.315
What are your concerns in that direction?,23887.855,23889.95502
"Are you talking about just coming out to the To finish the EVA, are you talking about to do something else?",23890.975,23896.1
Negative.,23896.34,23896.74
"This would be to clear them of AMS for your first, okay.",23896.74,23901.295
Away.,23901.295,23901.795
Fantastic.,23906.49503,23906.99503

Okay.,23913.68,23914.16003
"So, yeah, we have two options.",23914.16003,23915.2
We can start with that if you guys think that's best.,23915.2,23917.04004
We also have a recommended order of bringing out all of these inputs and getting you guys out of the worksite based on our conversations with robo.,23917.04004,23924.165
"As long as you get clear, we are happy with whatever you pursue.",23926.69995,23930.48
Okay.,23931.89996,23932.38
"Based on that, let us know what you're saying.",23932.38,23934.13995
The first thing that we were going to do was bring you a body out.,23934.13995,23937.735
"So, and I definitely can go into seats the SIM it's gonna be the simplest for clearance out of here, not going body aspects, bringing towards my APFR and the bags and everything.",23940.19495,23951.56006
Okay.,23953.675,23953.995
"Well, you guys have the best eyes in the clearance, so we will trust you on that one.",23953.995,23956.875
So we will bring you body down.,23956.875,23959.535
Yeah.,23960.76,23961.08

"I could see that occasionally that the, reel itself was getting caught on the edge of ELC two, and it was when I was moving, maybe in APFRs, but that was, probably in parting loads and the reel was staying put.",25676.59998,25698.00998
Yeah.,25699.745,25700.225
It makes sense.,25700.385,25701.365

I got them in a good position here.,25965.08,25966.84
Is it required to do that?,25966.84,25968.62

"We're just, wondering if the best config or limit the the amount of swinging and bashing around to those bags over a week.",25972.225,25979.445

Where the duo will exit the stay station's Quest airlock to install an upgraded International Space Station roll out solar array on the one a power channel on the starboard trust of the station.,1039.065,1050.16
So let's learn a little bit more about what the crew will do during today's spacewalk.,1050.22,1054.32
"This video is for the IsisS roll out solar ray or Irosa, one a, and Stolie VA.",1057.43503,1063.21503
"Steve Bowen, EV one, with the red stripes, egresses and receives a crew lock bag and puts it on his body restraint tether.",1063.59,1070.65
"EV two with white stripes, Whitney Hoberg, egresses with the acrylic bag on his body restraint tether and closes the thermal cover.",1071.365,1078.66498
EV one translates up the forward face of the truss and goes starboard.,1079.96,1083.66
"He stops to configure safety tether EV two follows a similar translation path and goes to the port, crew equipment, translation aid cart, to temporarily stow his bag and retrieve an articulating portable foot restraint.",1083.96,1097.24
"Meanwhile, EV one translates to thyrosa carrier, stows his bag, and retrieves his pistol grip tool.",1097.78,1104.805
"EV one begins preparing Irosa for removal from the carrier, first releasing a restraint bolt on the upper Irosa.",1105.425,1111.925
EV two relocates the foot restraint and installs it on the space station's robotic arm.,1113.03,1119.05005
"EV two ingresses the foot restraint, and then the arm will move them away from the truss.",1119.43005,1125.0149999999999
EV one translates to the lower rosa and releases its first restraint bulb.,1126.35504,1130.6950000000002
"He releases both anti rotation devices back on the upper eye rosa, and then will stow them in the crew lock bag.",1130.98,1138.76
"On the robotic arm, EV two is flown over to access two sets of volts on the boom end of the upper Irosa.",1141.355,1154.62
The first two bolts will allow the boom deployment system rollers to be moved into place to help with the array deployment later in the spacewalk.,1155.725,1164.065
The second two bolts will release two of four mechanisms that hold the erosa and its roll configuration.,1167.75,1173.865
"EV one partially releases the upper eye rosas restraint bolt and installs the first of two handling aids called scoops, and prep for removing Irosa from the carrier.",1175.20496,1185.38

On his way to meet e b two at the Mod kit.,1224.095,1227.395
Both crew will then work to install Irosa onto the one a mounting bracket.,1234.02,1239.079998
The crew will release the scoops and EV two will move into position to release the final bolt holding Irosa in its folded position.,1245.695,1252.89
"Once released, EV one will hold Irosa close while EV two egresses his foot restraint and gets into position.",1254.07,1260.555
Both crew will then work together to unfold Irosa and secure the right side onto the mounting bracket.,1261.735,1266.950005
"Once secured, EV two will drive two hinge bolts that hold Irosa in the unfolded position.",1268.21,1273.590004
EV two will then move away from myrosa to reconfigure a safety tether on the arm.,1274.875,1279.774994
EV one works to drive eight bolts to fully secure the Irosa to the mounting bracket.,1280.155,1285.61
Both crew will then work to electrically connect the new Irosa to the ISS power system.,1290.595,1295.495
"They'll first attach four connectors to Irosa, then both will move to either side of legacy array to disconnect the old array and connect a white cable.",1296.115,1305.69
This will allow power to flow from both the new Irosa and the legacy array to the space station power system.,1305.909996,1311.994995
"At this point, EV one moves into a deployment viewing position and EV two will release the final two bolts restraining Iroza in the undeploid position.",1320.45,1329.145
Iroza will deploy over the next six to ten minutes.,1329.845,1332.95
"During deployment, EV one translates back to thyroza carrier to reconfigure the carrier beams that previously held the upper Irosa.",1333.49,1341.465
"These beams need to be rotated out of the way to allow access to the lower Irosa on the second EVA Once deployment is complete, EV two will release two bolts that allow the rows of blankets to become tensioned.",1343.205,1358.02
"EV two then cleans up the mod kit worksite, retrieving his crew lock bag and heads to the carrier to help EV one with the carrier beams.",1359.335,1367.595
The crew members work together to release the bolts holding the beams in place.,1371.24,1375.02
Then they will rotate the beams out of the way and secure them back down.,1375.455,1380.035
This is the last task in the first DBA.,1381.375,1383.84999
Both crew will clean up the worksite and translate back to the airlock.,1392.2649999999999,1396.125
They will clean up their tethers on the way They will then work to ingress and begin repressing the airlock.,1396.745,1404.2
This will finish the first of two EVAs.,1404.66,1407.16
And that was an overview of what we can expect during today's space walk.,1415.88,1419.9
"On your screen here, on the top right, you see NASA astronaut Frank Rubio, continuing to step through procedures to get the crew ready to head out of the airlock later this morning.",1422.3600000000001,1432.205
"And towards the lower left of your screen, you see United Arab Emirates, astronauts, Soltan, Al Nayati.",1434.65,1440.59

Maybe three copies.,3773.61,3774.67001
"And copy, we've got Good voice.",3777.05,3779.295
"And, just to let you know, we're two minutes out for a twelve minute LOS.",3779.295,3783.795
And you are prime IV and your go to press.,3784.25499,3788.56
And I I copy prime IV.,3795.765,3797.605
Go to press.,3797.605,3798.08499
Thank you much.,3798.08499,3798.985
And we did just hear that confirmation from the ground that the crew is go to continued depressurization.,3805.45,3810.75
"First up, they'll close the hatch, which all Nayati and rubio working together to do.",3811.20999,3815.345
So you can see on your screen.,3815.345,3816.885
The flash is kinda closed.,3841.72,3842.84001
Good luck.,3842.84001,3843.32
We'll see you on hold.,3843.32,3844.04001
Yep.,3844.04001,3844.54001
Talk to you later.,3844.76001,3845.64
Thank you so much.,3845.64,3846.68001
Great.,3846.68001,3847.18001
Great.,3847.32,3847.40001
Great job.,3847.40001,3847.98001
It's not awesome.,3848.52,3849.42
And you did see that hatch just get closed.,3868.625,3871.525
We are in an expected handover between ground stations.,3875.56,3879.58
So we are not going to back to have video of the crew onboard the International Space Station for the next eleven and a half minutes.,3880.36,3887.98502
"However, we do know that they're going to continue the deep pressures process as they have the go from the ground to do so.",3888.20502,3894.46
"And if you're just joining us this morning, we have two space walkers who are suited up and in the process of Working through depressurization procedures.",3936.165,3945.49
"Today, they will exit the station's Quest airlock to install an upgraded Irosa or International Space Station roll out solar array on the one a power channel on the starboard truss of the International Space Station, We do have an animation to walk us through what we can expect our spacewalkers to complete today.",3946.19,3964.2
So let's take a quick look.,3964.2,3965.74002
"This video is for the Isis roll out solar ray, or Irosa, one a and Stolly VA.",3968.375,3974.1549999999997
"Steve Bowen, EV one with the red stripes, egresses, and re e v two with white stripes, woody Hoberg, egresses with the crew lock bag on his body restraint tether and closes the thermal cover.",3974.45502,3989.615
EV one translates up the forward face of the truss and goes starboard.,3990.875,3994.495
He stops to configure safety tethers.,3994.86,3996.88
"EV two follows a similar translation path and goes to the port, crew, equipment, translation aid cart, to temporarily stow his bag and retrieve an articulating portable foot restraint.",3997.82,4008.205
"Meanwhile, EV one translates to the Iroza carrier, stows his bag, and retrieves his pistol grip tool.",4008.745,4015.62003
EV one begins preparing Iroza for removal from the carrier.,4016.32,4019.965
First releasing a restraint bolt on the upper eye rosette.,4020.04498,4023.105
EV two relocates the foot restraint and installs it on the space station's robotic arm.,4023.805,4029.93
"EV two ingresses the foot restraint, and then the arm will move them away from the truss EV one translates to the lower erosa and releases its first restraint bulb.",4030.31,4041.69498
"He releases both anti rotation devices back on the upper eye rosa, and then we'll stow them in the crew lock bag.",4041.835,4049.66
"On the robotic arm, EV two is flown over to access two sets of bolts on the boom end of the Upper Irosa.",4057.625,4065.52
The first two bolts will allow the boom deployment system rollers to be moved into place to help with the array deployment later in the spacewalk.,4066.54,4074.965
"The second two bolts, will release two of four mechanisms that hold the Irosa in its rolled up configuration.",4078.54498,4084.81
"EV one partially releases the upper Irosa's restraint bolt and installs the first of two handling aids called scoops, and prep for removing Irosa from the carrier.",4086.06998,4096.265
"The arm flies EV two over to the hinge end of the upper irosa, and both crew members work to release the final bolt holding it to the carrier.",4097.37,4105.47
"EV one installs a second scoop, and EV two lifts the thyroza off of the carrier.",4105.925,4110.82498
"After several maneuvers on the robotic arm, EV two will arrive at the one a mod kit worksite.",4112.97,4126.3150000000005
"During these maneuvers, EV one will pick up the temporarily stowed bag from the port cart and reconfigure both cruise safety tethers on his way to meet e b two at the mod kit.",4127.01495,4138.18
Both crew will then work to install Irosa onto the one a mounting bracket.,4144.925,4149.985
"The crew will release the scoops, and EV two will move into position to release the final bolt holding Irosa in its folded position.",4156.59,4163.865
"Once released, EV one will hold Irosa closed, while EV two egresses his foot restraint and gets into position.",4164.96497,4171.5
Both crew will then work together to unfold Irosa and secure the right side onto the mounting bracket.,4172.6,4177.855
"Once secured, EV two will drive two hinge bolts that hold in the unfolded position.",4179.035,4184.51
EV two will then move away from my Rosa to reconfigure a safety tether on the arm.,4185.77,4190.67
EV one works to drive eight bolts to fully secure the Irosa to the mounting bracket.,4191.03503,4196.49506
Both crew will then work to electrically connect the new Irosa to the ISS power system.,4201.4399999,4206.3399997
"They'll first attach four connectors to Irosa, then both will move to either side of legacy array to disconnect the old array and connect a white cable.",4206.96,4216.585
This will allow power to flow from both the new Irosa and the legacy array to the space station power system.,4216.805,4222.83
"At this point, EV one moves into a deployment viewing position in EV two will release the final two bolts restraining Iroza in the undeployed position.",4231.275,4239.98
Iroza will deploy over the next six to ten minutes.,4240.68,4243.795
"During deployment, EV one translates back to the Irosa carrier to reconfigure the carrier beams that previously held the upper Irosa These beams need to be rotated out of the way to allow access to the lower rosa on the second EVA Once deployment is complete, EV two will release two bolts that allow the Irosa blankets to become tensioned.",4244.414997,4268.945
"EV two then cleans up the mod kit worksite, retrieving his crew lock bag, and heads the carrier to e v one with the carrier beams.",4270.21,4278.525
The crew members work together to release the bolts holding the beams in place.,4282.185,4285.965004
Then they will rotate the beams out of the way and secure them back down.,4286.39,4290.81
This is the last task in the first DVA.,4292.229996,4294.775
Both crew will clean up the worksite and translate back to the airlock.,4298.995,4307.08
They will clean up their tethers on the way.,4307.62,4310.12
They will then work to ingress and begin repressing the airlock.,4310.740005,4314.985
This will finish the first of two EVAs.,4315.525,4318.185005
"And, is a high lever level overview of what we can expect from today's spacewalk?",4326.22,4330.88
"If you're just joining us, two NASA astronauts are currently suited up and in the crew airlock and are working their way through depressurization procedures.",4335.205,4345.15001
"Today's spacewalk Spacewalkers are NASA astronaut, Steve Bowen, and today will be his ninth spacewalk, as well as NASA astronaut Woody Hoberg, who will be completing his first Spacewalk.",4346.57,4357.85
"Bohan and Hoberg will venture outside for a spacewalk expected to last about seven hours today, the focus of which will be on the starboard truss up the International Space Station to install and monitor the deployment of one of the Iroses or ISS roll out solar array.",4374.76999,4392.295
Both of which were delivered on a SpaceX cargo Dragon resupply vehicle on Monday to the space station.,4393.34,4399.12
And today's spacewalk is the two hundred and sixty fourth in support of space station assembly maintenance and upgrades.,4405.055,4411.715
"This is the seventh spacewalk in two thousand twenty three, and the fifth spacewalk for Expedition sixty nine.",4413.25,4419.59
"As we mentioned, it's the ninth spacewar spacewalk for Bowen, who has a cumulative spacewalking time of over fifty four hours crossed eight previous space walks.",4421.235,4431.73
The IRosa that the crew will install today is sixty feet long and twenty feet wide.,4446.15001,4451.53
"It shades a little more than half of the original or legacy arrays, which are one hundred and twelve feet long, by thirty nine feet wide.",4452.05501,4459.515
Each new Irosa produces more than twenty kilowatts of electricity.,4463.07,4466.61002
"And once all the Iroses are installed, it will enable a thirty percent increase in power production over the International Space Station's current arrays.",4466.67,4475.83502
And we are in a loss of single period as we have a handover between satellites.,4518.87003,4523.86502
"However, we are expecting communications and video to be back here in less than a minute.",4525.20502,4530.92
"During this loss of signal period, the crew has been stepping through procedures in order to work through depressurization of the airlock.",4533.32,4540.78
This is done in a two stage process.,4541.865,4543.885
"First, the crew lock goes down to five pounds per square inch of pressure at which point that depressurization will be paused to do a systems check.",4544.185,4551.90002
"And then following this, depressur depressurization will resume to bring it all the way down to the vacuum.",4552.2,4558.785
"Now once that vacuum is reached, the two spacewalkers will complete some additional suit and comm checks before placing their spacesuit on internal battery power.",4559.32498,4567.65
Officially marking the start of today's spacewalk.,4567.72998,4570.15
"And pressure inside of the crew lock is about seven point two seven pounds per square inch, again, will pause once that pressure reaches five pounds per square inch.",4617.265,4626.72
And station Houston on one.,4657.11,4658.55

"I copied, r four release two forty five turn turkey timer out.",9797.115,9801.77501
Copy.,9804.46,9804.78
Woody.,9804.78,9805.1
Great job.,9805.1,9805.66
"Our four release two hundred and forty five turns, and you see the turkey timer.",9805.66,9809.20001
You can work with Frank to move to the carrier back off.,9809.5,9812.40001
You just heard confirmation that NASA astronaut Woodie Hoberg finished releasing the fourth bolt.,9815.435,9821.295
That bolt was holding the IRosa in its rolled up configuration.,9823.81999,9827.43999
"Good, buddy.",9829.18501,9829.74501
"And, this is basically the figure logging out one meter, sixty centimeters, and that is application forward.",9829.74501,9837.86
You also heard them reference something called a turkey timer.,9838.0,9841.04
That is basically just a status indicator to ensure that the bolts are fully released.,9841.28,9845.62
We are now in a an expected handover will last about fifteen minutes.,9852.295,9857.37
We are currently about one hour and five minutes into today's space walk.,9919.155,9924.2
"It began at eight twenty five central time this morning, nine twenty five AM eastern time when the Space suit switched to battery power.",9925.54,9934.345
"Steve Bowen, who is EV one with the red stripes, egress the crew lock and received a crew lock bag.",9936.485,9942.58
"And then EV two, who is Woody Hoberg, followed him shortly after.",9942.64,9947.06
"Boen then translated up the forward face of the trust and went starboard, config configuring his safety tethers on the way, and then Hoberg followed a similar path but went to the port crew equipment, translation aid, or ceta cart to temporarily stow his bag and retrieve the articulating portable foot restraint.",9954.6,9973.095
Bohan then translated to that IRosa or International Space Station roll out solar array carrier.,9978.18,9983.24
Stowed his bag and retrieved the pistol grip tool.,9983.415,9986.315
"Bowen began preparing the Ira for removal from the carrier, first releasing a restraint bolt on the upper irosa.",9988.61502,9994.77
"Meanwhile, woody Hoberg relocated the foot restraint and installed it on the space station's robotic arm.",9996.50998,10002.665
"From there, Woody Hoberg ingress the foot restraint, and then, at the arm, moved him away from the trust and towards the work site.",10006.27002,10013.49002
Boen translated to the lower Irosa and released its first restraint bolt and then released both anti rotation devices on the upper Irosa.,10023.72,10031.42
And stowed them in the crew lock bag.,10031.82498,10033.925
"While on the robotic arm, Woody Hoberg was flown over to access two different sets of bolts on the boom end of the upper IRosa.",10034.625,10041.77
"The first two bolts allowed the boom deployment system rollers to be moved into place to help with the array deployment later in the spacewalk, and then the second two bolts released two of four mechanisms that hold thyrosa in its rolled up configuration.",10042.15,10054.345
"The goal of today's spacewalk is to install an IRosa, where international space station roll out solar array to augment power generation for the one a power channel on the space station Starbird Trust.",10122.44495,10133.56
The new solar arrays measure sixty feet long by twenty feet wide once they're deployed and shade a little more than half of the original solar arrays.,10136.34503,10144.51
Which are a hundred and twelve feet long by thirty nine feet wide.,10144.59,10147.89
Each new IRosa produces more than twenty kilowatts of electricity and once installed will enable thirty percent increase in power production over the station's current arrays.,10148.35004,10158.015
There's about six minutes left in this fifteen minute loss of signal before we'll return to seeing Steve Bowen and Woody Hoberg working on today's spacewalk.,10358.79999,10367.62
"Once we're back, we'll see Steve Bowen, working on releasing the upper Iroso restraint bolt and installing the first two handling aids called scoops in preparation for removing the Iro or international space station roll out solar array from the carrier.",10373.745,10388.675
"Currently aboard the International Space Station, we have the Expedition sixty nine crew, which includes NASA astronauts, Frank Rubio, who is inside the space station, helping with today's spacewalk.",10401.225,10412.43
"Also inside the space station is UAE Astronaut Sultan Alnayati and Ross Cosmos Cosmonauts, Sergei Percopia and Dimitri Patelin.",10413.20999,10421.47499
"And then, of course, our space walkers today are NASA astronaut Steve and in Woody Hoberg.",10422.25499,10426.93001
"Here in the room, we have flight director Diane Daily at the helm, and she goes by the call sign horizon flight.",10435.425,10442.96501
"And then serving as the Prime Ground IV, we have Jenny Givens.",10446.28,10450.14
"There's about one minute left in this loss of signal, and then we'll quickly return to seeing what woody Hoberg and Steve Bowen are progressing.",10667.77,10676.465
Today's spacewalk is the two hundred sixty fourth spacewalk in support of space station assembly maintenance and upgrades and the seventh spacewalk out of the Space Station for this year.,10698.25,10707.71
So I'll have that forty seven minutes to go.,10758.59503,10764.115
"It's not Hi, Prussian.",10764.115,10771.3825
"So during that loss of signal, Steve Bowen release the upper Irosa restraint bolts and installed the first two handling aids called scoops in preparation for removing the Irosa from the carrier.",10778.015,10790.68

"Right off the discount that moved to that position,",14397.20996,14399.47
Yeah.,14400.16,14400.39999998

We like it.,14442.535004,14443.515003

You are doing great.,14605.48,14606.7
We have a really good timeline laid out in front of us.,14607.445,14610.565
So good in fact that there is a potential that the next eclipse could be our working eclipse.,14610.565,14615.625
For our cablemates.,14616.07,14617.05
That's in around twenty five minutes.,14617.35,14619.37001
"So we might break out of bolts and take that opportunity while we have it, and I'll keep you both up to date on that.",14619.67,14625.495
"There is no rush because, again, our nominally planned eclipse was the following one.",14625.89499,14630.155

Alright.,14639.08,14639.56
Good.,14639.56,14640.06
Next piece of information I have for you is that we have noticed that a grounding pin is out of place on the mod kit.,14640.28,14646.905
It's at the base of the mounting bracket where the mounting bracket meets the left slower strip.,14647.525,14653.66
"After the unfold, we're gonna have to address that grounding pin.",14654.76001,14658.84
It should be no problem.,14658.84,14660.06
"But I will let you know, and I'll give you those words again when the time is right.",14660.125,14663.745
Sure.,14665.805,14666.305
"And just to be clear, that's on Steve's side, and we don't want him to check it now.",14669.59,14673.53
I'm gonna go anywhere.,14675.545,14676.42502
I can't let go.,14676.42502,14677.48502

Alright.,14684.96002,14685.44
That's he's just trying to be some light.,14685.44,14688.42
Those are all the big picture words that I have for both of you.,14690.135,14693.415
"We will pick up after these robo maneuvers with a fair lead for woody and then start to, work toward unfolding Irosa.",14693.415,14702.21002
"Your warning is that this is a pinch point, and you'll need to keep clear of rotating Iroza.",14702.83002,14707.855
Who's your family?,14713.88,14714.68
Did you guys take that?,14714.68,14715.82
I was wondering that to you.,14716.44,14718.06
"But you might be able to head that way, then when you get to the lower, just drop it.",14718.28,14721.98
"Your fairlead is gonna be on the right, lower stretch, lower hand, reality.",14723.745,14728.005
Right.,14731.02002,14731.26
"Lower, stroke, lower handrail.",14731.26,14732.7
Got it.,14732.7,14733.44

"And woody, you need to hold.",14743.315,14744.995
The reason why we're waiting is because we cannot put this fairlead in while the arm's moving.,14744.995,14748.92
Yeah.,14750.66,14750.82
I understand you guys.,14750.82,14751.62
I was just checking out the location.,14751.62,14753.06
Thank you.,14753.06,14753.54
Alright.,14753.54,14754.02002

"That's a good idea, stand by.",14810.17502,14811.875
We are about two hours and twenty seven minutes into today's space walk as NASA astronaut Steve Bowen and Woody Hoper continue to install the International Space Station roll out solar array onto the one a starboard truss.,14845.86002,14859.32498
"They are about an hour ahead on their scheduled timeline, and now targeting a working eclipse about twenty one from now for the cable meeting.",14863.66,14872.845
"Since you had your visor down, pick a selfie, you'll get the whole I truly could check the station.",14891.445,14898.03998
The cable meeting is when both of the crew members will work to electrically connect the new IRosa to the International Space Station power system.,14901.3,14909.27502
They'll first attach four connectors to Erosa and then both will move to either side of the legacy solar array to disconnect the old array and connect a Y cable.,14910.61502,14919.24
This will allow power to flow from both the new Irosa and the old legacy array to the space station's power system.,14919.375,14925.715
What do you wanna able?,15006.64,15007.8599997

Yep.,24214.43,24214.915
We have not tightened those adjustables at all.,24215.075,24217.155

Okay.,24383.52,24383.84
That's great to know.,24383.84,24384.56

So I copy that.,24473.51498,24474.57498
Okay.,24474.63498,24474.875
I'm not sure.,24474.875,24475.435
Those are good.,24475.435,24476.335
To get the r one or r two from here.,24476.85,24480.71
Might be by calling on the end of the array here.,24482.29,24486.31
So it could play the whole box.,24487.665,24489.025
Right?,24489.025,24489.525
"So flight, he would Copy, Steve.",24493.105,24497.03
We think that the best position for you here would be actually holding on to the mud end effector.,24497.33002,24501.73
We agree you will not be able to reach unless you are actually on the boom end of Vyrosa and the FSE.,24501.73,24507.965

Alright.,25341.45,25341.95
So what does full rotation mean?,25342.01,25344.26999
The rollers need to contact the blanket and the deployed position.,25345.61,25349.39
K.,25351.985,25352.30501
They are now in contact.,25352.30501,25353.52501

"Steve, you are going to translate to crew lock bag tee where you're gonna clean up that crew lock bag, we are still tracking that the socket caddy is outside.",25386.975,25396.39
"So we need that tucked back in, and then cleaned up such that the doors are facing the tower.",25396.93,25403.735
Alright.,25405.795,25406.11499
Is there any reason to leave that bag out here?,25406.11499,25408.375
"Affirm, you are leaving crew lock bags out there.",25409.62,25412.6
"And and for the next EVA, are we leaving it out here?",25414.9,25417.62
It's my question.,25417.62,25418.44
We've stowed.,25418.935,25419.655
"I think everything will get a stow in tea, is that?",25419.655,25422.235
"Steve, give us a check, a second to check on that.",25422.615,25425.41501
We're about thirty seconds for a handover.,25425.41501,25427.435
Understand.,25430.28,25430.76001
I'll get configured and then we can if you wanna leave it out or bring it in.,25430.76001,25434.28

I'm gonna leave it out here.,25513.175,25514.79498
"I'm trying to make sure it stays facing the FSE, it's kinda hard to do.",25518.69498,25523.21
Can I use the wire tied to do that if we're gonna leave it?,25523.61,25526.27
"Hey, firm, Steve.",25534.595,25535.475
"We've confirmed you will need to leave it there because we need a socket for the c bolt release on EVA two, but you can, use a wire tie to help you stow it.",25535.475,25546.545
"As long as the tethers are still attached, that's fine.",25546.625,25549.52502
"Oh, yeah.",25551.265,25551.58502
No.,25551.58502,25551.905

That sounds good.,25635.02,25636.16

You'll be retrieving that as well as crew lock bag m so that on your BRT?,25642.625,25647.5
Copy all.,25649.88,25650.78
A slight EBA to serve woody just to be conscious of that tough skateboard and then a little bit of a band bag if you Wouldy an additional reminder of you to speak there if that test cable just in front of the crew lock bag?,25700.56,25725.53503

Is this something else that needs to be great?,25750.44,25752.38
The duo then egress.,25753.08,25754.54

"From there, they work to release some anti rotation devices on the upper IRosa or international roll out solar array.",25775.395,25782.615
As well as a couple of sets of bolts on the boom end of the upper irosa.,25782.89,25786.91
You are going to get off of the FSE via the poa and we will have you translate back to the airlock leading.,25788.25,25794.185
They then worked to remove the IRosa from its carrier and installed a scoop so that,25794.185,25799.805
"NASA astronaut, Woody Hoberg could lift the IRosa from the carrier.",25800.08,25803.3799999

They then worked to install the Irosa onto the one a mounting bracket.,25815.8949995,25820.14
And then they unfolded the erosa and secured the right side onto the mounting bracket.,25829.815,25834.555
Shortly after they electrically connected the new IRosa to the space station's power system.,25836.219997,25842.399998
After releasing the final two bolts holding the IRosa in an undeployed position.,25849.364998,25854.29

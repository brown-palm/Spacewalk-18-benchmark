Afterwards.,23066.77948,23067.27948
I think that's a false torque.,23067.339170000003,23069.897920000003
It's a slow torque.,23069.897920000003,23071.037600000003

"Small, small reps.",30232.584230000004,30233.643950000005
And that completes everything internally.,30236.182440000004,30238.081740000005
And can I get that for one second?,30245.006880000004,30246.726010000006
Yeah.,30246.726010000006,30246.965900000007

"You see in my I'm looking at that right mid for you, Zena.",30249.664320000003,30255.121840000003
Right.,30262.752410000005,30263.252410000005
I don't see any gaps from this perspective.,30267.834780000005,30270.133880000005
"We copy, Josh.",30278.487980000005,30279.707610000005
We're looking especially for the inboard side of the right mid.,30280.407010000006,30284.065440000006
I might have a better view of that from here.,30287.523260000005,30289.742400000006
So give me one second.,30290.241910000004,30291.541500000007
Want me to get back in the APFR?,30292.549840000007,30294.169280000006
"Stand by, Josh.",30296.267980000004,30297.247740000006

"On the APFR, you don't need to ingress, and you'll be taking a look at the inside of the right mid stret, so the side that's closest to the left strut.",30372.013060000005,30381.308540000005
Okay.,30383.607120000004,30383.966940000006

Five hours and forty two minutes into today's EVA or spacewalk.,30408.973940000003,30413.112120000005
The two are currently in cleanup procedures Frank Rubio is doing an inventory check on the tool bag while Josh Casper is checking the MLI or that multilayered insulation around the mid strut that was just installed.,30413.811520000007,30430.642270000004
"Hey, Josh.",30487.888540000004,30488.488240000006
We are seeing a gap in the right mid strat MOI.,30488.488240000006,30492.186640000004
"Instead of having you translate all the way down and around out to where Frank was accessing it, we'll give you a go to translate on the mod kit very slowly, gently.",30492.714880000007,30502.370300000006
And go access the MLI to get it covered.,30502.999700000004,30505.298800000004

I'm not sure if you've started filling up the process.,30584.302140000003,30586.681140000004
But we do need an inventory of the TBA bag.,30587.199840000005,30589.638640000005
We were gonna leave that for Josh.,30589.638640000005,30591.258040000004

"So it looks like that was the one thing external on the strut bag was a large, small adjustable.",30661.266620000006,30666.753280000004
"Copy, Frank.",30669.451684000007,30670.271520000006
Is that going to the TBA bag?,30673.199800000006,30675.099100000007
It is it is on the handrail property stock bag.,30677.677560000004,30681.296000000006
Got it.,30682.874284000005,30683.274080000007

"If you're able to see with your wrist mirror, that would be helpful.",30698.924920000005,30701.623826000006
But definitely looking a lot better in our camera view.,30705.601580000006,30708.220520000006
I see now the DA bag.,30713.197700000004,30720.693640000005
Starting off with a wrench.,30722.712380000004,30724.451760000004
"At his case, it looks like a one inch wrench.",30725.399804000004,30727.538980000005
That is on a adjustable.,30728.358320000007,30731.137180000005

"Josh, you're good with that right mid strip.",30760.848530000007,30762.727590000006
You can go ahead and head back towards the strip head.,30762.727590000006,30766.186110000006
Copy that.,30768.663910000007,30769.403780000004

Back to the APFR WIFX.,30772.641920000005,30774.521230000006
Okay.,30777.029510000004,30777.529510000004
Pretty much what is a adjustable Yep.,30780.467790000006,30784.634580000005
On the other side is an adjustable with each band having half a wrench.,30784.634580000005,30789.492400000006
That is wide to another adjustable.,30790.031890000006,30792.011160000005
With a Roger wrench on the other end and no socket.,30794.529340000005,30799.587070000005

I think this question was just the loose stuff prior.,31388.258230000007,31390.91715000001
I was wondering if it's worth putting that loose nothing here because this both of them was better.,31392.194880000006,31396.852820000007
You want me to bring it over and do that?,31399.271350000006,31401.290590000008
I don't know if they're gonna do it another inventory after switching.,31403.129240000006,31409.82614000001

"Copy all, Josh.",33576.401690000006,33577.421440000006
Papa papa fox six sounds like good settings with the clocking of six.,33578.27994,33582.57804
The goal is just to have that APFR just be a really low profile.,33582.63777,33586.2162
I'm sorry.,33589.00411,33589.44384000001
You said clocking of six.,33589.44384000001,33591.02334000001
"The clocking of the APSR still as we found it, which I think was twelve.",33591.282940000005,33596.70474
Yep.,33596.70474,33596.90464
It's twelve.,33596.90464,33597.644490000006
What's that considered?,33605.677300300005,33606.5771

"Okay, Josh.",33641.49714000001,33642.056860000004
We'll have you go ahead and actually adjust that clocking.,33642.056860000004,33644.675800000005
One eighty off to clocking of six.,33644.915080000006,33646.8741
That occurred.,33646.8741,33654.010780000004
Okay.,33654.73986,33655.059700000005
"First, let me pull the twist tab on the width extender.",33655.059700000005,33658.55820000001
I'm gonna take my RET off of that to put it on the APFR.,33658.69788000001,33661.436763000005
"Copy, Josh.",33663.814880000005,33664.414580000004

"See, I don't so the back locking is gonna work.",33674.827876,33677.466555000006
It's gonna be hitting the the brakes.,33677.466555000006,33679.64572
V dynamic breaks here.,33680.96458000001,33682.50406000001
"Can you rotate it the other direction, it can rotate either left or right clockwise or counterclockwise?",33685.96208500001,33690.72856
I could get it pointed back into station if that's what you want.,33693.227060000005,33696.085880000006
"Hey, firm.",33697.16492,33697.6047
That'd be great.,33697.6047,33698.46452

Okay.,33731.59412,33732.09412
"Okay, Josh.",33757.74831,33758.26804
We're thinking maybe you can just adjust the pitch on the WIFX.,33758.26804,33761.64661
To get this as low profile over the seated cart as possible.,33761.875060000006,33764.973770000004
Yeah.,33767.872070000005,33768.07196
I can actually go more station Venus.,33768.07196,33770.411040000006
That's what you mean.,33771.31983,33772.45951
"Affirmative, Josh.",33773.91852000001,33774.85831
"Affirmative, straight up.",33777.3568,33778.85631
Okay.,33779.66492,33780.16492
So it's for complete.,33780.184660000006,33782.463520000005
That's good.,33782.463520000005,33782.98326
Full twist test on a APFR now adjusting the pitch on the lift x.,33782.98326,33788.28087

As low profile as you can possibly get it by adjusting the pitch here.,33815.40402,33818.742600000005
Okay.,33855.330050000004,33855.60991000001
I think that's what you initially intended.,33855.60991000001,33857.5092
I think I gave you the wrong setting there.,33857.568940000005,33860.36754000001
That's alpha.,33860.36754000001,33861.30734000001

Can I hit the brake right now and just go mater and get the hooks?,33930.27477,33933.133590000005
I'm in a great position to get the the starboard break.,33933.31324,33936.331990000006

"Copy, Josh.",33947.12447,33947.76414000001
We're probably happy with that.,33947.76414000001,33949.7834
"We may have you depress that inboard, see the brake levels on your way back in after cleaning up.",33949.96306,33954.38109

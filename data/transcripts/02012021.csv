"Martina wants to know how the temperature changes during sunrise and sunset while space walking, how the suits are dealing with it, and if astronauts have the possibility to take a drink while on the spacewalk.",21412.19,21423.245
"In the sunlight, when the space station is in an orbital daytime, it can be two fifty degrees Fahrenheit, and without sunlight, it can be a negative two fifty degrees outside.",21425.13,21433.87
"Therefore, the spacesuits have a cooling garment that allows the astronaut to control the temperature inside the suit, as well as thermal properties keeping them warm.",21434.235,21442.81497
"Additionally, in the suit is an in suit drink bag that's a plastic water filled pouch that attaches to the inside of the hard upper torso.",21444.04,21452.22

Go ahead.,29559.92,29560.5
"Okay, sweetie.",29562.72,29563.59999
We don't think you're going to need step one.,29563.59999,29567.275
"We will take care of step four, and you do not have to perform step five or six as well.",29567.655,29573.515
"Step, skip step one, and you take four, five, and basically six as well.",29578.72,29586.485
Okay.,29586.485,29586.985
Another look back at today's numbers.,29745.435,29747.995
This was two hundred and thirty fourth spacewalk in support of station assembly maintenance and upgrades.,29747.995,29753.12
"And it was the second spacewalk of the year, but the third for Expedition sixty four, one, having occurred out of the Poisk module, and two, out of the Quest module, as we saw today.",29753.66,29763.63498
"It was the fourth Spacewalk of Mike Hawkins's career totaling twenty five hours and fourteen minutes in all, and the second for Victor glover, who now has twelve hours and sixteen minutes of spacewalking time.",29763.935,29774.695
Today's spacewalk lasted five hours and twenty minutes.,29775.255,29778.61502
"And of all of the spacewalks conducted at the International Space Station, they had totaled sixty one days seven hours and seven minutes of space walking time.",29778.61502,29787.27
Houston station on one.,29788.37,29790.22998
Now the crew of PPD almost zero.,29790.44998,29793.395
"So if you guys concur, we're moving on to the one decimal two four zero post EVA.",29793.395,29798.535
Herlock Houston.,29805.1,29806.24
We are tracking and we concur.,29806.3,29808.4
Yeah.,29809.145,29809.645
Copy.,29812.425,29812.905
"So while moving on to the out of the cue card, we're moving on to our old CBA.",29812.905,29816.925
"If you want me to, but we are now officially in the post EVA, and we will we will now open the hatch for details.",29828.565,29836.18503
So standby for that.,29836.24503,29837.545
You're welcome.,29837.82,29838.4
"We do pressurization complete Jack's astronaut, Suichi Noguchi prepares to open the hatch between the crew lock and the equipment lock portion of the Quest airlock.",29855.82,29864.495
"And copper was having the, ATBCG.",29939.655,29941.91504
Yep.,29943.04004,29943.28
I think that's a good plan.,29943.28,29944.66003
"NASA astronaut, Kate Rubin's now working to move Mike Hopkins, our EV one, our extra vehicular crew member one, into the equipment lock portion of the Quest airlock where she and Suichiniguchi will help him doff his space suit.",30027.814999,30042.27
Yeah.,30101.105,30101.345
You need to help her.,30101.345,30102.305
I wanna take her safer from here.,30102.305,30104.145004
"So, Can you grab on to the hunger?",30104.145004,30106.76
It's not a hunger.,30106.76,30107.64
Yeah.,30107.64,30107.96
That's good.,30107.96,30108.700005
Airlock Houston space to ground one crew.,30118.915,30121.15501
EV crew is no longer hot mic.,30121.15501,30123.255005
K.,30127.7,30128.2
So Ejune and Gucci has removed Mike Hopkins SAFER or simplified aid for EVA Rescue.,30150.38501,30155.52501
"And as you saw, we didn't need that today, but always useful to have just in case.",30156.40001,30160.98001
That would help the astronaut maneuver back to the International Space Station should they become detached for any reason.,30161.12001,30166.69499
"However, they are always using tethers to stay attached.",30166.75499,30170.295
"With Hopkins back inside the equipment lock portion of the Quest airlock, Rubens and Naguchi will work to maneuver glover back into the equipment lot portion as well.",30320.815,30330.99
This is where they will help the space walkers duff their space suits after today's five hour and twenty minute spacewalk starting at six fifty six AM central time and ending at twelve fifteen PM central time.,30333.77,30347.23
Twelve sixteen PM central time.,30348.25,30350.17
That is.,30350.17,30350.91
"The International Space Station is currently flying two hundred and sixty two statute miles to the over, the South Pacific Ocean to the west of French Polynesia.",30445.00998,30454.565
"As you can see, both spacewalkers are now back inside the equipment lock portion of the Quest airlock.",30455.345,30461.285
A NASA astronaut Victor glover's safer or simplified aid for EVA rescue has been removed as well.,30463.46,30469.63998
You can see the workstation that allows for connections to tools and,30596.47003,30600.0
Others has been removed from Victor glover.,30600.0,30602.58
The astronauts now preparing to doff their suits.,30602.8,30605.62
"Another look back at everything they accomplished today, completing all of their scheduled tasks and even several of their get ahead tasks.",30610.1449995,30618.404999
"First, the space walkers completed the battery upgrades that began in January two thousand seventeen by driving a final bolt into a lithium ion battery.",30619.71,30627.73
And is installing a final adapter plate to complete the power circuit.,30628.115,30632.135002
They also installed a bolt into a DCSU or direct current switching unit.,30632.435,30636.614998
Before my coffins move to remove an H fixture.,30636.96,30640.42
That prepares the International Space Station for future power upgrades.,30641.68,30645.14
There were three cameras upgraded or replaced today.,30646.565,30649.785
The first was a CP three HD camera at the starboard truss.,30650.085,30654.425
There was also a camera replaced on the Japanese experiment module remote manipulator system.,30655.100002,30660.56
And a CP thirteen HD camera installed outside the US lab.,30662.315,30666.895
"That completed the main scheduled tasks for our spacewalkers, and they moved into get ahead tasks, beginning with another age fixture removal by Hopkins, and APFR or articulating portable foot restraint configuration for a future spacewalk by Victor glover.",30669.310005,30686.645
Glever also removed and replaced an airlock magnet to help the thermal cover stay closed.,30687.19,30692.729996
And Hawkins took photos of the exterior of the station to document its current state.,30693.19,30697.975
From the time the space walker switched their suits to internal power at six fifty six AM central time this morning.,30701.93,30707.93
"It took them five hours and twenty minutes to complete the aforementioned tasks, concluding the spacewalk at twelve sixteen PM central time.",30707.93,30716.715
The installation of the battery completed today as well as the three cameras have all been reported to be in good configuration.,30793.25499,30799.71
"Hopkins and glover are now removing their spacewalk gloves, which can be very rigid to use in the, during a space walk outside the International Space Station.",30880.155,30889.25
So the suit is kept at a pressure of four point three PSI or pounds per square inch.,30889.25,30894.71
To make that flexibility a little bit easier.,30894.835,30897.255
And Victor glover is all smiles after having his helmet removed today being his second space walk after completing his first just last Wednesday.,30918.4,30926.34
Sohichi noguchi and Kate Rubin's working to remove the helmet from Mike Hopkins today's lead space walker.,31066.515,31072.215
"Now that both astronauts have their helmets removed, we are going to wrap up today's coverage.",31099.445,31104.185
Thanks so much for tuning into the spacewalk today.,31104.32498,31107.065
"Where Mike Hawkins and Victor glover completed the final upgrades of the battery power system, as well as installed three new cameras.",31107.46,31115.64
"We are looking forward to two other EVAs or spacewalks in the future, and we hope you'll join us for those as well.",31116.325,31121.765
So stay tuned for more information.,31121.765,31123.385
"But for today, that's it for us.",31123.96,31125.96
This is Mission Control Houston.,31125.96,31127.58

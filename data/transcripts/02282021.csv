And that's just a simple power switch to to power cycle that high definition view.,810.90241,815.1605400000001
"The current wireless capability for HEKA will allow us to see some of those high definition views mostly on the way to and from today's worksite out at the far end of the p six truss, port six truss coverage at the port six Trust is a little bit spotty when it comes to the high definition camera.",817.74883,834.8983000000001
"So we may have to rely on some of those standard definition views more so, but we'll still see if we can get some of those high definition views.",834.8983000000001,843.1039000000001
Kate Rubin's for her space walking procedures today will be on at the top of a a foot restraint to get her the proper angle to affix the mounting bracket to the mass canister.,843.5634200000001,856.13724
That gives her a good angle at first installing a centerpiece and then some of the struts on the side of the mast canister.,856.51679,863.96262
"Hopefully, we'll be getting some good views from her.",864.38214,867.0011000000001
"There's plenty of time on the timeline today as Naguchi and Hopkins, both unsuited in the equipment lock right now.",877.35492,884.25171

Now the brackets themselves are kind of long and shoved into a bag that will be essentially a little bit larger than the chronauts themselves in terms of length when configured.,1553.41489,1565.93854
You see all the different struts that are pointing on the modification kit here.,1566.1581700000002,1570.2249800000002
They're configured in a bag and stowed away.,1570.5848100000003,1573.00384
Both of the astronauts will take out a one bag each each meant for two different masked canisters on the port six trust.,1573.3833900000002,1581.0298200000002
"One on the four b power channel, the other on the two b power channel.",1581.36939,1584.64774
This is the power channel.,1584.64774,1585.7671800000003
It was on the earth facing and space facing side.,1585.7671800000003,1588.3349600000001
Of the far end of the International Space Station.,1588.4549000000002,1591.27374
"Essentially, this is their work for today.",1592.4129400000002,1594.4119400000002
The first task will be installing this configuration on the two b power channel.,1594.4119400000002,1598.9791400000001
This is the power channel that's on the earth facing side.,1598.9791400000001,1602.2974600000002
You can see sort of on the on the right and then towards the earth there.,1602.2974600000002,1605.8759200000002
That is their primary task for today.,1606.4647400000001,1608.6039100000003
The remainder of their time will be setting up the four b channel.,1608.98349,1612.9617400000002
And they'll be setting up that mounting bracket and getting as far into the procedures as they can.,1613.1499400000002,1619.3670700000002
It is expected that through the course of the six and a half hours that they will not complete those activities just by design the way that the procedures are laid out.,1619.8266,1628.9209600000002
But that is okay.,1629.2499400000002,1630.1695000000002
"We have another spacewalk coming up next Friday, March fifth.",1630.1695000000002,1633.5880100000002
And the first task on that spacewalk is to complete the work of installing that mounting bracket on the four b channel.,1633.6877100000002,1640.5230700000002
"So far, we're staying right on the timeline for today's activities preparing for our two space walking astronauts to head out the hatch.",1657.3723800000002,1664.1983
They're scheduled to switch to battery powered officially begin today's spacewalk about an hour from now.,1665.4174200000002,1670.57364
What you're seeing now is Soichi Naguchi on the left and my Hopkins on the right preparing what's called a SAFR.,1671.87271,1678.75906
This is a simplified aid for EVA rescue.,1678.75906,1681.37802
This is one of the final steps before the astronauts themselves are situated in the crew lock.,1682.4772000000003,1688.3133400000002
What's in the crew lock now is this bag.,1691.6099900000002,1693.8089000000002
This is called a modification kit bag.,1693.8089000000002,1695.5680200000002
And what you saw was the the modification kit.,1695.5680200000002,1698.8064000000002
"Once it is fully installed, this is what it looks like.",1698.8064000000002,1701.1250400000001
Stowed in the bag.,1701.2449700000002,1702.5445600000003
"All components fit inside the bag except for the mounting bracket, which will be affixed to the outside of the bag.",1702.76422,1710.38064
"Again, the length of those bags will extend even a little bit more than the length of the astronauts themselves.",1712.2893400000003,1718.1866400000001
They're quite big.,1718.2063400000002,1719.2261400000002
But each of the astronauts will have one of these modification kit bags in tow as they make their way out to the very far end of the International Space Station's Port Trust.,1721.3742100000002,1732.4981400000001
"Once they're out there, you can see the configuration.",1734.67684,1736.61609
This the configuration with the mounting brackets that you can see on the left.,1736.7158400000003,1740.9932400000002
"And once they are on the right there, this is what the configuration will look like once the the new solar arrays themselves are deployed.",1741.0929,1748.3188400000001
"Again, the solar arrays have not yet been delivered to the International Space station.",1749.17814,1753.3848400000002
"What you're seeing now is the preparation work to make sure that once they are delivered, that they could be hooked up and ready to go.",1753.3848400000002,1759.9218400000002
The work today is just installing that mounting bracket.,1760.2699400000001,1762.90864
You're not wiring anything to get ready for drawing power from those irosos.,1762.90864,1768.9259000000002
"Once each new ray is installed, it'll be drawing in more than twenty kilowatts of power each.",1776.58164,1782.8684400000002
"Back to the quest airlock, you're again looking at the fight aid for EVA rescue the SAFER unit that will be affixed to the",1792.1733400000003,1800.0000400000001
Bottom portion of their of the back of their space suits.,1800.83962006,1804.4980400000002
This is one of the final steps before they are situated in the crew lock.,1807.6349400000001,1811.73314
The simplified aid for EVA rescue provides propulsion.,1816.0999800000002,1818.9987800000001
Should the space walkers become untethered at any point during today's spacewalk?,1820.13796,1824.51602
"Highly unlikely, but it is that fault tolerance that provides the safety needed for our space walking astronauts today.",1825.974539,1832.9513000000002
As we lose some of the video and audio feeds from the international base station.,1947.7717100000002,1951.5598100000002
What you're looking at is the white flight control room.,1951.5598100000002,1954.0785400000002
This is one of the room supporting today's spacewalk.,1954.0785400000002,1956.3776500000001
"This team, orbit one, has been supporting Astruments, Kate Rubens, and Viktor Glover that are suited up, and of course, Suicina Gucci.",1956.6372600000002,1964.5924900000002
"And Mike Hopkins, who are helping them get prepared for today's spacewalk.",1964.5924900000002,1969.0393600000002
This is the Orbit one team.,1969.0591100000001,1970.63857
They are nearing the end of their shift as the new shift Orbit two plans to come in who will be leading our space walkers through their procedures today.,1971.21803,1979.37271
Now as both of our astronauts continue to get situated and prepared for today's spacewalk scheduled to go out the door and start today's spacewalk in just about an hour from now.,1987.63704,1998.9000500000002
Let's take a moment to look at some of the procedures that they will be prepared for ahead.,1999.0599800000002,2003.9178000000002
"For US EVA seventy one, EV one will egress the joint airlock first.",2006.3448400000002,2011.3226100000002
"You'll see EV one has the red stripes, and EV two, the white suit.",2011.3423400000001,2015.4892800000002
EV two will pass out the two strut bags containing structure to support new solar arrays.,2015.5090300000002,2021.8860900000002
Eighty two will head out to p one where he will install the anchor hooks or the crew safety tether.,2022.0149800000002,2029.33004
And this is what we call a slingshot and we'll give them a hundred and seventy feet of length that they need to get all the way out to p six.,2029.6898600000002,2036.7865700000002
"At that point, both crew members will translate to p six and install their respective bags on the four bravo and two bravo.",2037.9246400000002,2046.6205400000001
Worksites.,2047.34992,2047.84992
EV one will translate back inboard and retrieve a portable foot restraint.,2050.82818,2056.12577
With a extension and head back to join EV two at the two brother worksite.,2057.38456,2064.2813800000004
"EV1 will set up this portable foot restraint or access to the mod kit installed and then translate over to the bag where both crew members will begin building what we call the upper triangle, which includes the mounting bracket and leftstrut and a right strut.",2065.07972,2083.53974
They'll use their pistol grip tool to assemble that triangle.,2084.1192100000003,2087.29786
"Once it's complete, EV one all be in the portable foot restraint and EV two will hand it off to EV one.",2088.1172,2094.86304
Here you see EV one installing this on the mass canister.,2095.76234,2099.0209400000003
And there's a strong soft dock feature that will hold it in place.,2099.55998,2102.97854
"Once it's positioned in place, even one will use the pistol grip tool to drive four bolts.",2103.7179,2108.33586
One will then reposition the foot restraint for access to the left side of the mok kit.,2110.52444,2116.42176
Here you see the mid strut on EB one's body restraint tether.,2119.31919,2122.8177
EB one will hold the lower strut while EB two gets into position.,2123.7569700000004,2127.29544
Now work together to install the left lower strut.,2128.42457,2131.24339
"EV two will start off by driving the bolt with his pistol grip tool, and EV one will drive the upper bolt that connects it to the mounting bracket.",2131.5430100000003,2141.38832
I'll then work together to install the mid strip on the left side You can see EV two driving four bolts that hold it to the mass canister.,2142.76737,2154.05184
Similar to the h fixtures that were recently removed.,2154.3299700000002,2157.0288800000003
And EV one will drive the bolt to secure it to the upper strut.,2157.7682600000003,2161.34672
And one will then reposition the APFR and get back in after getting the mid strap on her BRT.,2164.4645800000003,2172.56077
Near teas standing for body restraint tether.,2173.4799000000003,2175.81894
So get back into the portable foot restraint.,2181.3945400000002,2183.57368
Receive the right lower strap.,2185.19264,2188.05146
And then EV two will translate around the mass canister for access to the installation point for the right lower strut.,2189.45994,2196.8365000000003
"Again, just like the left side, they'll be working together to drive their respective bolts with their pistol grip tool.",2197.62467,2203.76184
EV two will translate up for the mid strut install.,2209.1681000000003,2213.14637
Or he'll drive four bolts.,2215.89381,2217.67317
EV one will have a single bolt.,2217.85282,2219.75212
And the EV two will tighten the clamp bolts on both sides.,2220.86994,2224.16856
"The mid strengths are telescoping, and this clamp bolt prevents it from telescoping any curve there once it's in place.",2224.38819,2230.1850400000003
Accrual then work together to secure the thermal blankets over all of the struts and make sure their employees as well as verifying that the pit pins that provide grounding pads for the structure are also in place.,2233.46339,2246.06614
They'll then grab the necessary tools and head over to the four bravo worksite.,2248.11484,2252.53288
Very similar kind of a mirror image to what they were working on previously.,2253.9918900000002,2257.4904
EV1 will install the APFR or the portable foot restraint.,2258.55954,2262.5778
And they'll work together again to build the upper triangle consisting of the two upper struts and the mounting bracket.,2264.59654,2272.72239
"Maybe one in the in the portable foot restraint, we'll receive the upper triangle, install that in place.",2276.44996,2282.66709
"And they'll get set up to install the final piece to get to what we call the minimum configuration by installing this right, lower strut.",2284.6949600000003,2294.42961
The system is now in a good configuration to leave it out and operate space station nominally.,2295.3289400000003,2300.70649
"If we didn't have this installed, then we would need to perform a tie down to make sure that everything was structurally sound before heading back in.",2301.43494,2308.4517
"If there is extra time, we'll continue to build the four bravo mod kit on the CVA.",2309.9598800000003,2314.53784
"If not, we have plans to perform the rest of the install.",2315.11729,2319.0156
On the next EVA.,2319.46501,2320.5647400000003
The crew will then pack the empty bag with the tools that they plan to bring inside.,2321.6239400000004,2325.8420800000004
EV two will carry that back to the airlock.,2327.30994,2329.84894
Both crew members will translate back to the airlock from p six.,2330.62827,2334.64654
"They'll leave the slingshot out, meaning that the tethers will be strung out to p one because we'll use them again on a future EVA.",2337.3640400000004,2345.8289400000003
EV two will put the bag in the airlock in ingress followed by EV one we will then close the hatch.,2346.20854,2352.53459
What you just saw was an animation that will be following the procedures scheduled for today.,2365.53494,2370.97224
"Now, what you just saw was our two space walking astronauts completing the mounting bracket installation on the two b power channel.",2370.97224,2379.69774
This is the power channel that faces the earth.,2379.69774,2381.91684
"And the schedule as as it is written now is for them to start the procedures on the four b channel, which is space facing side, but the plan is that they may run out of time.",2382.07504,2393.88767
They may exhaust the total allotted six and a half hours that they have.,2393.88767,2397.5861
Before they,2398.41508,2399.70764
Need to go ahead and head back inside and complete today's spacewalk.,2400.04012,2405.45766
"But if that is okay, they are scheduled to complete that work next Friday, March fifth.",2405.5973404,2410.4847800000002
"Rubins will head out once again this time with a Jackson astronaut, Suuija Naguchi, who you see as a suit IV, helping our two space walking astronauts get set up.",2410.98428,2420.488139
He's positioned on the left there wearing the JAXA t shirt.,2420.488139,2424.10658
"NASA astronaut, Kate Rubens, is already inside the crew lock.",2425.55476,2429.75266
"She's got her SAFER unit, which is currently being a fixed to Victor Glover that you see Suuichi Naguchi on the left and Mike Hopkins helping him out get that safer unit affixed to his suit that has a simplified aid for EVA rescue and provides propulsion.",2429.75266,2446.1334
"So in the unlikely event that that glover were to become untethered during today's spacewalk, can propel himself back to the International Space Station, just one of those fail safe that helps them to be successful for today's spacewalk.",2446.832797,2459.9165000000003
This is the final step before a glover will be situated inside the crew lock.,2461.964618,2467.54208
"Rubins is situated on the nadir side or towards the bottom of airlock lever, it will be positioned towards the top of the crew lock in the back there.",2470.8986600000003,2480.0829
So it will be Rubens that'll be out the door first.,2480.6623640000003,2483.24132
"She'll be wearing the suits with the red stripes for today and a glove is, as you see now, is wearing the suit with no stripes.",2483.760104,2491.8563
"Once our astronauts head outside, they'll turn on their wireless video system, And for Kate Rubin, she has a high definition camera that will be test running for today's spacewalk for the first time.",2496.7831,2506.6672000000003
The cameras that you can expect to see on the screen.,2507.86486,2511.4033400000003
Okay.,2512.0227840000002,2512.34262
Rubens will have a translucent number twenty.,2512.34262,2515.1214800000002
"At the bottom of the screen, and Victor Glover will be helmet camera number twenty two.",2515.2101000000002,2519.708094
Correction.,2526.4537800000003,2526.9537800000003
It'll be Victor Glover will wear the suit with number twenty.,2527.09346,2532.7908700000003
And Rubens will be the one with helmet camera number twenty two.,2532.98012,2537.19826
This is mission control Houston.,2645.1738800000003,2646.7331
"Again, you are getting you are getting my views from the International Space Station.",2646.7331,2650.43151
Victor Glover is currently being positioned inside the crew lock today.,2650.7600700000003,2656.25759
His setup procedures are complete.,2657.9351100000003,2660.1542400000003
Lead checks are good.,2660.25394,2661.67348
Tethr's and tools are configured and ready to go.,2662.5728,2665.58019
Now Hopkins is inside the crew lock with him and Suichi Naguchi giving him one final push to get him positioned and and ready for today's spacewalk.,2665.86004,2675.4355
On the ground in the International Space Station flight control room.,2680.0829000000003,2683.48974
There is currently doing a handover today.,2683.48974,2686.62844
Flight director Marcos Flores is leading the room.,2687.32784,2690.52624
He'll be the flight director for today's spacewalk and leading our crews and the and the teams on the ground here through their procedures.,2690.52624,2698.29234
Frank Rubia will be the ground IV.,2699.15166,2701.13094
"He is was well, the astronauts hired in for the twenty seventeen class, took his two years of training and is now officially an NASA astronaut It'll be his voice that you hear from here in Mission Control Houston to our two space walking astronauts once they head out the hatch.",2702.14004,2719.2215100000003
The space walking officer today is Art Thomason.,2724.17794,2726.91684
Who walked us through some of the procedures for the briefing a few days ago.,2728.29479,2733.35254
"It is his job to know the procedures forwards and backwards, and work with his team that is supporting in the back room.",2734.2918,2741.90819
"The mission once again today is to install some mounting brackets on the mass canisters of the current solar arrays on the port six Trust, the very far port end of the International Space Station.",2748.53386,2759.7983400000003
"You see Jack's astronaut, Switching Naguchi, with a communications handheld next to him.",2785.60264,2792.12964
He has a direct line to the two space walking astronauts today.,2792.74907,2795.78752
"Kate Rubens and Victor Glover, Victor positioned with his head towards the camera.",2795.78752,2800.54421
Kate Rubin's just out of frame situated with her head towards the hatch.,2802.36304,2805.48149
She'll be the one to open that up.,2805.48149,2807.0101400000003
And be the first one out the door today.,2807.13008,2809.34924
"From this view, position to the right of Victor Glover, you see two very long bags inside are the druts for the mounting bracket that'll be installed today.",2818.97389,2828.37862
"They're quite long, and you see they do take up quite a lot of room in the airlock today.",2828.37862,2833.33516
"Once they're situated outside of the airlock, both rubens and glover, they'll pass out those strut bags containing all the all the equipment that they'll need for today's activities, of course, the pistol grip tool they already have affixed to their we'll call it a tool built.",2833.61501,2851.1762
But the strap bag will be maneuvered outside of the airlock.,2853.57421,2858.1122

"Again, you are looking at a live view from the mission control center.",7271.11762,7275.015920000001
International space station flight control room.,7275.49502,7278.073984000001
"The ground IV, Frank Rubio, you just heard giving the translation path to our astronauts.",7289.31732,7295.99365
"Right now, they did their buddy checks on the outside of the Quest Airlock.",7296.17331,7300.911190000001
"Everything looked good, their helmets were configured, their video systems turned on, and all their tools and the strut bags are in tow.",7301.13015,7308.32521
"Now they have a predesignated translation path, which means they know of the route to get to their worksite.",7308.5251100000005,7315.14205
They have to take a very specific path through taking specific handrails to get there along the way Kate Rubins is scheduled to pick up a portable foot restraint to get her in position for some of the work that she'll be performing.,7316.40013,7329.06317

Still getting good audio from our space walking astronauts who are making their way out to the worksite.,7410.73451,7416.35195
"So on the far port trust of the International Space Station, they'll be working on both of the mass canisters out on that worksite.",7417.17018,7424.18692
The mass canisters are the soda can looking fixtures that originally deployed the solar arrays that are out on the p six now.,7424.2066700000005,7432.14203
"They'll be installing a modification kit a bracket, if you will, that will hold a future set of solar arrays that will augment the power on the port six truss.",7432.161760000001,7442.1952
There are two power channels out on the port six plus the four b and the two b power channels.,7442.51505,7447.332890000001

It's alright.,14663.025800000003,14663.545550000003
"If you need to, you can either use your hand or a RET to maybe re try to realign that spherical bearing prior to and hand starting.",14663.545550000003,14674.059500000003
"Frank, I don't think the RET is gonna do much.",14682.803400000003,14686.900920000002
And maybe just saying we'll get one app.,14693.297700000003,14695.176770000002
"I don't know if we could Yes, sir.",14695.176770000002,14697.545500000002
There's a lot of fiction in there.,14697.545500000002,14699.244900000003
Okay.,14703.960800000003,14704.460800000003

"And it's, like, degrees from from perfectly flush.",14710.757400000002,14714.144640000002
It's not into the whole lot.,14714.144640000002,14717.563200000002

Do you think that's causing a misread as because of the angle misalignment?,14736.032030000002,14740.439400000003
I don't think So I think it's it's lined up as we're driving.,14743.217760000003,14748.153820000003
I'm not sure what the the fault it feels stress and kind of pictures and have those and orientation it wants to be used.,14748.153820000003,14755.559340000003
Seems like this critical being extra pad on the lower stress lineup.,14755.739000000003,14762.844900000002
And then it it seemed like it will drive straight one to three days.,14763.504300000002,14767.760970000003
But it's not because the spherical band is moving.,14768.440630000003,14770.759480000002
It's because the but it has a little bit of place Okay.,14770.759480000002,14776.845400000002
We're checking.,14777.065050000003,14777.624770000002

"So we're gonna what we're gonna have you do is just try to hand start it and just maybe give us some feedback on how you think that's going, if that's causing a misthread or extra friction as your hand starting it?",14854.979870000003,14868.642400000002

She's been in this position to install the lower and middle struts.,16624.387100000004,16629.234210000002
You can get a good view from her angle of that configuration.,16630.333420000003,16633.192210000005

I only got one from the next tab.,19595.249940000005,19597.149260000006
Okay.,19598.248460000003,19598.688240000003
Understand.,19598.688240000003,19599.188240000003
K.,19600.247440000003,19600.367400000003
Thanks.,19600.367400000003,19600.867400000003
I got one turn into that stop.,19605.844330000004,19607.403560000002
You did before we had a good stop.,19607.403560000002,19609.142960000005
Understand.,19610.101560000003,19610.601560000003
I we're discussing hold and I'll have our speech shortly.,19610.661290000004,19616.218510000006
We're gonna have a handover here in about ten seconds.,19616.218510000006,19618.877410000005
Once again losing video from the International Space Station should be regaining it here shortly just in a couple of seconds.,19641.594610000004,19647.880340000003
"In the meantime, glover is continuing to work on that adjustable part of the mid strut on the right side.",19652.316560000003,19657.414280000005
I come back right through.,19671.235960000005,19671.995580000003
How do you hear it?,19671.995580000003,19672.475360000004
How do you hear it?,19672.475360000004,19676.333660000004
Okay.,19677.561400000006,19677.961190000005
So will we thanks for gonna work best here.,19677.961190000005,19680.280030000005
"Or we're gonna attempt this to walk the clamp alternating sides So complete one additional turn on that side for two turns total, and then it will alternate by two turns at a time.",19680.280030000005,19691.593140000004
I'm a Mike.,19727.303320000003,19728.191620000005
Twelve.,19728.231600000003,19728.711360000005
Yeah.,19728.711360000005,19728.991260000003
"Mike, let me fix that.",19728.991260000003,19729.950720000004
I only got one turn and one point eight on the torque.,19729.950720000004,19733.409260000004
Okay.,19739.664830000005,19740.164830000005
We copy.,19740.344460000004,19741.084360000004
Alright.,19741.423920000005,19741.863760000004
And are you able to get any additional terms on your side?,19741.863760000004,19745.161590000003
I Negative.,19749.839060000006,19774.456520000003
Okay.,19780.313330000004,19780.813330000004
We copy.,19781.472760000004,19781.992530000003
I we're discussing I have worse for you shortly.,19781.992530000003,19784.681260000005
"Are you doing alright, Kate?",19908.878835000007,19910.278140000006
I'm doing good.,19910.278140000006,19911.217915000005
My head back too.,19912.956470000005,19914.056170000007
How are you doing?,19916.994450000006,19917.854276000005
Yes.,19919.473210000007,19919.973210000007
Good morning.,19921.632130000005,19922.292060000007
"Right now, Victor Blover and Kate Rubin's both standing by.",19936.663610000007,19940.322030000007
Glove has been working on that middle strut.,19940.841400000005,19942.880380000006
The adjustable the bolt's near the adjustable section of that middle strut on the right side to secure it in place.,19942.880380000006,19949.417360000007
"Engineers on the ground are currently evaluating some of the next steps, making sure it's good to go, or if there's any additional steps needed.",19949.756430000005,19956.533300000006
Stay on a plan.,19956.633000000005,19957.552530000004
"Unfortunately, It involves a little bit more than just continuing to drive in who these bolts are versus me here shortly.",19957.552530000004,19969.535160000007
"But, frankly, the the smart folks are talking about this in gram.",19971.553910000006,19974.411440000007
A solution in testing some of the VoLTE IDs.,20007.171420000006,20009.710410000007
It would've found me there.,20014.487770000007,20015.747380000004
"Alright, guys.",20019.795110000006,20020.614950000007
So two step plan.,20021.074470000007,20022.613940000007
"First step, Kate, for you is we're gonna have you go and get the torque wrench.",20022.793610000004,20026.191470000005
We feel like we're gonna need that for possibly this clamp and also for the lower struts.,20026.351400000007,20031.848900000005
And so the programmed should be in the other bag.,20032.588280000007,20035.885370000007
Right.,20035.885370000007,20036.385370000007
Okay.,20044.250840000004,20044.650640000007
Correction.,20044.650640000007,20045.150640000007
That's the ratchet wrench.,20045.210360000005,20046.489720000005
Now we're looking for a ratchet wrench.,20046.489720000005,20048.189120000006
Yeah.,20050.007970000006,20050.207860000006
I'm curious again.,20050.207860000006,20051.286460000007
"And, Kate, how does the other bag?",20064.609200000006,20066.628450000007
Yep.,20066.768130000004,20067.087960000004
"For that translation path, essentially, you're gonna go back to the train head, zenith, and over to the bag.",20067.087960000004,20074.863220000007
K.,20074.863220000007,20075.363220000007
So Victor Lever is going to remain in his position on the right middle strat.,20101.305970000005,20105.524100000006
"In the meantime, Kate Rubin's is going to translate to the bag that's currently on the zenith side.",20106.903170000005,20112.569650000005
"At the beginning of the space walk, they both brought a strut bags out to the worksite, one for each of the power channels.",20112.749300000007,20119.275330000004
They're using the ones on the to be channel now and there's a ratchet wrench in the other bag.,20119.574930000006,20124.932260000005
She's just gonna go grab it.,20124.932260000005,20126.241460000005
And possibly use it for securing the bolts on some of the lower struts and even possibly the middle strut.,20126.721230000006,20134.417600000004
"Engineers on the ground will continue to evaluate that, but she'll get that, and that'll help secure some of these some of these remaining parts down of the modification kit.",20134.726320000005,20144.461700000007
To the mass canister.,20144.631350000007,20145.851000000006
No problem ever.,20146.110630000006,20146.790300000004
Alright.,20146.790300000004,20147.290300000004
"And, Kate, you're gonna be heading over to the four bravo bag.",20154.076360000006,20157.734780000006
Copy.,20159.753500000006,20160.253500000006
I'm sorry.,20168.487680000006,20169.127350000006
"The the rods are a couple of degree from being, like, perfectly clear because they are both in between the plates on the front.",20169.127350000006,20176.503600000007
Copy.,20182.310280000005,20182.810280000005
Okay.,20186.748050000006,20187.107880000007
Alright.,20187.107880000007,20187.547640000004
"So based on that, we're gonna go ahead and release the bolt.",20187.547640000004,20190.436440000005
So your settings will be bravo five counterclockwise two.,20192.095370000006,20195.833740000005
"Oh, five, five o'clock, what do you say?",20224.228280000007,20226.116460000005
Those are good works for the settings icon.,20230.394320000007,20233.232900000006
You'll just rotate the bolts back until they are free.,20233.232900000006,20237.960000000006
Okay.,20295.634770000004,20296.134770000004
"Between twenty five and twenty six Copy, Ike.",20297.633800000007,20305.908420000007
You can stow your PGT and you're gonna take the telescoping portion and rotate essentially there's a tooth mechanism and we wanna make sure that the teeth aren't hitting each other.,20306.168030000004,20316.851840000007
So you'll rotate both pieces and then align the bars back up and try to get it as close to perfectly aligned as possible.,20317.181300000007,20327.015800000005
"Hey, Frank.",20352.391200000005,20352.831000000006
And I'm gonna need more vectors on the translation tab.,20352.831000000006,20355.529940000008
See the bag.,20357.868500000004,20358.688300000005
There's no hammer on screen.,20360.107400000004,20361.526900000004
Rag and I met with eighteen p six.,20361.866370000007,20364.805150000007
"Copy, Kate.",20368.143200000006,20368.742960000007
And we're checking.,20368.742960000007,20369.662500000006
"However, it's free shortly.",20369.662500000006,20370.882100000006
One side of this vacuum move.,20380.945600000006,20382.664700000005
But the other side is pretty picky in place.,20382.664700000005,20384.903600000005
I'm not able to move it at all.,20384.903600000005,20387.520800000006
Yeah.,20387.520800000006,20388.020800000006
"Beside with the bolt heads on it, you can get it through bringing it out.",20389.839630000006,20393.836600000006
"On the other side, there was a few place.",20394.796100000007,20398.014740000006
Okay.,20400.121500005003,20400.521300050004
Copy.,20400.521300050004,20400.881120050006
I I think rotating one side maybe still have the same effect.,20400.881120050006,20406.398360000003
"And so if you can just align them back up, then we'll try to reattemptable.",20406.398360000003,20410.566520000004
They will say rotate together.,20413.544780000004,20415.024040000004
So if we took them because I'm not able to rotate.,20415.024040000004,20417.443080000005
I'm trying to lock the bracket the thing I'm trying to tighten.,20417.542780000003,20420.011100000003
I cannot I cannot rotate it relative to the piece of the And that side is fixed.,20420.790460000004,20429.215440000004
I'm not sure if it was.,20430.554520000005,20431.934080000003
When I try to grab the what's that which what's supposed to rotate relative to what?,20436.530040000005,20441.647480000003
Does the telescope be portion?,20441.647480000003,20443.186962000003
There's nothing really rotating right now.,20443.796280000006,20446.215320000003
Okay.,20450.033160000003,20450.533160000003
"I understand, like, Okay.",20450.832760000005,20483.862730000004
"Heiko, and In that case, once you have them aligned as close to perfectly as possible, we're gonna attempt to re drive the bolts with the higher torque side.",20483.862730000004,20494.386570000006
Affirmative.,20501.801490000005,20502.301490000005
Okay.,20504.600086000006,20505.100086000006
Ready?,20507.318730000003,20507.818730000003
"And, Kate, it looks like you figured it out.",20519.589600000003,20521.748520000005
"You continued heading inboard over to the Johnny Instructure, and then you'll go ahead and delete it.",20521.748520000005,20527.424440000003
K.,20529.083360000004,20529.583360000004
"Well, we're still working on the middle section of that mid strut on the right side going to redo some of those bolts at the adjustable section in the middle there at this time at a higher torque.",20535.858660000005,20546.782670000004
"In the meantime, Kate Rubin's coming back with a ratchet wrench.",20546.782670000004,20550.350310000005
It will be bravo six clockwise two.,20550.350310000005,20552.889300000003
Almost six o'clock last Tuesday.,20582.603000000003,20584.361560000005
Good words.,20587.400040000004,20588.099930000004
Which one would you like me to start with?,20600.623000000003,20602.321560000004
Yeah.,20604.920260000003,20605.200120000005
"Like, we're gonna start with a tab side again and do the same walking method where you do two turns here.",20605.200120000005,20611.916570000005
And then alternate two turns on either side.,20612.076500000003,20614.295630000004
And that's the flip driver back.,20641.789940000006,20643.609270000004
You want it to take care of it?,20646.156500000005,20647.635760000005
The application on the inside.,20647.675740000006,20648.935360000003
"And, Kate, the ratchet wrench should be near the wired caddy.",20662.565830000003,20666.144290000004
"And Frank, both seven torqued out.",20757.868990000003,20759.726600000005
On the second iteration.,20761.525700000006,20762.745330000005
Copy.,20768.641330000006,20768.961160000003
I and is the tab still moving?,20768.961160000003,20770.700530000006
Yes.,20773.239020000005,20773.739020000005
It still looks good.,20775.118080000004,20776.377720000004
It's one third of each cab.,20777.915810000006,20779.615210000004
Okay.,20782.113710000005,20782.553500000005
Understand.,20782.553500000005,20783.053500000005
We're checking.,20783.473030000005,20784.172960000004
But there's also no longer any free play on the VoLTE Okay.,20788.449560000005,20802.920540000003
Understand no more free play.,20802.920540000003,20804.279880000006
"Like, does the clamp look symmetrically closed at this point, like, on both sides?",20804.279880000006,20808.378060000003
Do they both sides have an equal gap?,20808.786530000005,20810.725830000003
Copy.,20818.541510000003,20819.041510000003
"And, like, do you have any idea on the current account for both sides?",20822.739410000006,20826.117980000003

"And Nike came in talking on the red button, but hold on.",20847.625030000003,20852.221660000003
So three three total on each one.,20856.139680000004,20859.038490000003
Okay.,20860.806640000003,20861.126500000006
I understand.,20861.126500000006,20861.686190000004
Three turns on each side.,20861.686190000004,20862.985810000006

"Yes, Kate.",24738.859399999998,24739.29917
That would be great.,24739.29917,24740.17874
"And that'll be your primary task will be to reposition that Hey, dear, for our Webex.",24740.17874,24745.23624
"Time before only building the upper triangle on the other side, we need what do you wanna do?",24751.241609999997,24756.119179999998
PGT wise in in the bag.,24756.119179999998,24758.13842

"Like, we we agree with your plan.",24829.28588,24831.105219999998
We should only need the short PGT to build the upper triangle.,24831.124959999997,24834.063739999998
"And so if you wanna swap out, you can leave the wrong PGT on the two alongside and take the short PGT with you.",24834.32336,24841.16015
Am I leaving the bag or am I talking with the bag now?,24850.27509,24852.89404
We're gonna we're gonna lose the bag for now.,24854.83158,24857.19039

Okay.,24864.066939999997,24864.566939999997
"Got the rifts, and I met it back inboard, the triangle, and then Copy.",24864.81658,24876.08971
"And, Kaye, right now, on video, we're seeing at your ingress age.",24876.869069999997,24880.72741
Is still extended.,24881.146539999998,24882.046339999997
I do you wanna do a visual on that?,24882.34594,24883.74524
Just make sure that you don't need to address that before she starts to translate.,24883.74524,24886.684009999997
All I see is this done right now.,24890.101039999998,24892.00034
And you see where you can see that case on?,24896.45784,24898.216969999998
Yep.,24898.216969999998,24898.71661
"So again, the modification kit on the two b power channel, you can see a really good view from this angle as the sun sets in an or into an orbital night time.",24914.82647,24923.75161
Station is on the So let me consume a room.,24924.1914,24927.62966
Alright.,24927.62966,24927.829579999998
We're about two hours down on the time line to build the upper try and go and get it properly stowed.,24927.829579999998,24934.7362
We are looking at going slightly over seven hours.,24934.795919999997,24938.09454
I just wanna see how how you guys are feeling and what's your thoughts are on that plan.,24938.514059999998,24942.941609999998
Yeah.,24950.856239999997,24951.17611
Just be careful.,24951.17611,24951.935719999998
We got no time to do a good ingress.,24951.935719999998,24953.6751
That that does account for plenty of time for Ingressgate too.,24957.271569999997,24960.61016
So it sounds like the crew is up four going on the other side on the four bravo side that faces space.,24981.81644,24988.013339999998
The observation path is gonna look very similar from when you went and got the Roger Ranch.,24988.013339999998,24993.070239999997
"As the sun sets into an orbital night time, they're continuing to wrap up their work side on the two bravo side.",25000.64494,25005.94256

"Their next task is to build the upper trying angle, which was the first task of today for the two bravo side.",25020.813589999998,25025.99024
We'll start that on the other side and simply just tie it down.,25026.0899,25030.028189999997
Leave it in a good configuration nice and tight for them to address it on a on the next Space Walk scheduled for March fifth.,25030.84624,25039.940789999997

And then you can begin your translation to the four bravo side.,25047.8861,25051.004539999998
Yours is much family of translation.,25051.004539999998,25052.98379
You should just be able to go Zenith on the outboard forward aspect of the IEA.,25053.04351,25059.199539999998
Alright.,25190.710339999998,25191.03014

Correct?,25311.824075,25312.324075
Okay.,25318.78045,25319.22023
So you will head outboard.,25319.22023,25320.559815
"And when you get to the near aspect of the IEA, your head aft.",25321.459115,25327.48499
Alright.,25345.43522,25345.93522
But I'm gonna put it down a little while.,25352.65125,25354.99033

Flight controllers checking Ruben's location.,25449.044280000002,25451.10349
One of her tasks is to stow the portable foot restraint that she's been using throughout the duration of today's spacewalk.,25451.16322,25457.02978
"Get it nice and close to her worksite, and she'll have to address next spacewalk.",25457.56928,25462.02728

The other tasks that Reuben's and Glover will both attempt to tackle will be the construction of the triangle.,25475.06045,25480.59628
"This was the first section of the bracket that was built at the beginning of today's spacewalk and will eventually be mounted on the top portion of the mass canister as the first portion of the modification kit that needs to be installed, though it will likely not be installed during this space rocket will be installed later.",25480.59628,25498.97561
"So what they'll do is they'll just construct that upper bracket and then tie it down, make it nice and secure, so they can go ahead and just grab it.",25498.97561,25505.52154
On the next space walk.,25505.68145,25507.18096

We can see some of the work that glover has been doing to construct this triangle that sun should eliminate his work a little bit better.,27126.899919999996,27135.155879999995
"Also, we should get a better view of Kay Reuben's work to temporarily stow the portable foot restraint.",27135.695369999998,27143.401179999997

It's a weird lighting right now.,27220.154709999995,27221.854109999997
I got the intersection of the pin and third is is it a joint semi in the green A forward side close to my phone?,27229.039199999996,27241.982179999995
Star TV is you see it looks customer hole in our T.,27246.309629999996,27253.185139999998

"Quick copy, and we see at least part of that on the WVS.",27262.949919999995,27266.768239999998
You can go ahead and just take the as much time as you need to do a proper inspection on that.,27266.867939999996,27271.155519999997
If you're okay.,27276.692509999997,27277.552309999995
Okay.,27279.620699999996,27280.020509999995
I can't tell the face if there's a hole in the fabric or a fracture of the fabric to weave on the fabric?,27280.020509999995,27284.878339999996
I'm thinking it's the way of the server.,27285.486509999995,27287.785609999995
Bladder to lower TV where I can see it clearly pop.,27295.211439999995,27297.870339999998
Okay.,27300.168939999996,27300.668939999996
We copy.,27301.328369999996,27301.848109999995
Right?,27301.848109999995,27302.348109999995
"Take it over here, maybe I can show you and take a a call and I take care of yourself.",27305.285339999995,27309.103699999996
And for my blood check.,27309.651699999995,27310.971039999997
Yep.,27310.971039999997,27311.210939999997
And that's exactly where we were thinking.,27311.210939999997,27312.650209999996
"I Nomenal, well, the RTD peeling.",27312.650209999996,27318.266739999995
"On the right little curve, dry half semi other way.",27318.986389999995,27322.165069999995

Got inboard and then send down the IA.,27326.361569999997,27329.120179999994
No problem.,27329.120179999994,27331.419279999995
Alright.,27374.294439999998,27374.614289999998
"So we're gonna use a long duration, apparently, on this And if so, I can maybe send still one now.",27374.614289999998,27380.360639999995
"We are, like, we're gonna use both long duration tie down tethers.",27381.899599999997,27385.278169999998

Yep.,27395.791499999996,27396.191279999995
And correction.,27396.191279999995,27396.910939999994
We're actually gonna use three long duration tie downs.,27396.910939999994,27399.569839999996
"Like disregard last, it'll just be two long duration tie downs tethers, and they will be on each of the handrails on the upper Strucks.",27415.450779999996,27423.346409999995
I'll probably hang in to your left.,27423.346409999995,27430.523069999996
Nearing the six hour mark into today's spacewalk.,27436.619199999997,27439.877809999994
Glover has completed the construction of that upper bracket.,27441.896179999996,27446.314209999997
His next task will be to go ahead and secure that upper triangle to the truss of the international space station.,27451.160099999997,27459.985659999995
"It won't be installed on the mass canister for the spacewalk, but it'll be easily accessible and already structured, ready to go for the next space walk coming up March fifth.",27459.985659999995,27470.949639999995
"And you can see just beyond that upper triangle, the portable foot restraint is stowed in its position.",27474.426579999996,27480.463559999997
That was the work that Kate Rubens did just a little earlier.,27480.463559999997,27484.241909999997
You are tracking on my left hand?,27485.171169999998,27487.990019999997
Yes.,27488.129699999998,27488.489539999995
I'm tracking it.,27488.489539999995,27489.509279999995
I don't know where to let me do something to hold still.,27494.915339999996,27497.534299999996
Yes.,27497.873869999996,27498.153719999995
I'm you just hold the camera.,27498.153719999995,27499.672969999996
Yeah.,27499.672969999996,27500.172969999996
And for that review.,27502.261379999996,27503.441039999998
Can you confirm?,27507.178939999994,27507.998739999995
Yep.,27509.056519999995,27509.376369999994
It's the finger is centered on the camera.,27509.376369999994,27512.214939999994
Can you just get the get your hand closer to the camera?,27512.214939999994,27515.493339999997
Right?,27515.493339999997,27515.993339999997
Okay.,27519.361339999996,27519.681239999994
Camera close.,27519.681239999994,27520.501039999996
Camera close to the fingers.,27520.680739999996,27522.100239999996
"That works, sir.",27523.479339999994,27524.419099999996
Really a little down for the line.,27528.786639999995,27530.406099999997
Think I think that's fabric.,27546.136079999997,27547.375439999996
"If you look at the bottom of that digit piece and bigger pieces in the fabric, just stands out because it's been that it has a hole in RTV's past in RTV.",27547.375439999996,27559.108439999996
Okay.,27564.354099999997,27564.854099999997
I got several I think we have as good a view as we're gonna get.,27564.873869999996,27568.920339999997
We'll just attempt to minimize that hand minimize the use of that hand as we finish up the tie down.,27568.920339999997,27575.257439999998
And clean up and then head back to the airlock.,27575.836339999994,27578.375339999995
Copy.,27580.154209999997,27580.654209999997
Engineers here in mission control Houston taking a look at your gloveers left glove.,27589.088639999994,27593.286099999998
The upper triangle on top of the IEA.,27593.585739999995,27596.044709999995
I can't walk you in.,27597.143889999996,27598.503199999996
The,27598.503199999996,27599.003199999996
"Sunopad is going to be facing outboard, and the bracket is gonna be facing inboard.",27601.680800099995,27607.138319999995
With the hooks pointing up.,27607.926380299996,27610.785199999995
The triangle is gonna be centered on the middle battery in the middle row of batteries.,27614.901399999995,27622.237979999994
So the triangle is essentially setting smack in the middle of the IEA with the bracket facing inboard.,27625.245379999997,27631.742381999997
Okay.,27645.973982999996,27646.253844999996
I can help you.,27646.253844999996,27647.233603999994
So that triangle will essentially sit right on top of the lithium ion batteries that make up the interface of the electronics assembly that they're referencing.,27649.691199999994,27659.205919999997
This is pretty close to the worksite for the next spacewalk.,27659.225659999996,27662.684179999997
They have the proper configuration.,27663.103719999996,27664.443299999995
And now just the next step will be to just tie it down.,27667.930999999993,27670.489719999994
Should be good.,27670.489719999994,27671.569179999995
I can actually get this all the way to the center of the IEA.,27671.569179999995,27674.388019999995
Okay.,27681.234049999995,27681.593863999995
Three hooks up.,27681.593863999995,27682.793265999993
And will the screw pad out of board or screw back in board?,27682.793265999993,27685.851979999996
"The center pad is outboard, and the bracket is inboard.",27687.720763999994,27691.539109999994
This is the cinnabat.,27702.461203999996,27703.480939999994
Okay.,27703.900479999997,27704.380239999995
No.,27704.380239999995,27704.580139999995
"It's gonna be, like, dude.",27704.580139999995,27705.499679999994
Yep.,27705.499679999994,27705.699584999995
Yep.,27705.699584999995,27705.859503999996
On that whenever you pick up.,27705.859503999996,27707.058899999996
And I can go over this.,27707.058899999996,27711.905179999994
Let's see where we're gonna help you.,27711.905179999994,27713.844459999997
Yep.,27714.743759999994,27715.023619999996
So I your description was correct.,27715.023619999996,27718.191639999994
"And on the side nearest to you, so on the forward aspect, it'll be on handrail five three three five three five three.",27719.231124999995,27727.647159999993
"And on the aft aspect, it'll be on the opposite handrail five three zero six.",27728.626349999995,27733.843989999994
We've got a five three five five.,27736.022649999995,27737.951649999995
It's not five thirty.,27738.791239999995,27740.010869999995
No worries.,27742.589329999995,27743.069099999993
"Can you give yourself more than five thirty r three, maybe.",27743.069099999993,27745.946419999997
Yeah.,27752.261569999995,27752.541419999994
"Sorry, guys.",27752.541419999994,27753.221089999995
We had a incorrect number here.,27753.221089999995,27754.700339999996
So it's five three five zero is what you're looking for on the forward aspect.,27754.700339999996,27758.098639999997
Five that.,27758.098639999997,27761.006629999996
We're gonna need to extend the Long duration time on tether.,27766.503639999995,27771.070409999997
Uh-huh.,27771.070409999997,27771.570409999997
Five three five zero.,27793.985979999994,27795.545199999993
Do you have a preference for outboard or inboard extension blindsided?,27795.545199999993,27800.003229999995
No preference.,27804.060629999996,27804.720539999995
Great.,27804.740289999994,27804.980169999995
Alright.,27804.980169999995,27805.480169999995
Thank you.,27808.218539999994,27808.818239999993
Am I holding up the bag on the supervisor?,27808.818239999993,27810.757529999995
"Like, we will be folding up that bag.",27827.976419999995,27830.035639999995
We'll just finish this side together and then have you translate down there to pick up that bag.,27830.055379999994,27834.133339999997
Yeah.,27834.133339999997,27834.633339999997

I'll see you on the other side.,27841.599599999994,27842.979159999995
Alright.,27848.675929999994,27849.175929999994
"Once again, another handover of some of the video coming down from the International Space Station.",27856.990639999996,27862.248279999996
"Rubins and glover are tying down the constructed upper triangle that makes up the modification kit of the four b channel, power channel?",27863.086299999995,27872.450859999994
Sure.,27873.430109999994,27873.789939999995
And then go get it.,27873.789939999995,27876.108759999996
Okay.,27876.108759999996,27876.388639999994
I'll figure with the tether is on it.,27876.388639999994,27878.147759999996
It's on the handrail.,27878.147759999996,27879.076639999996
See.,27879.116639999997,27879.316519999997
Yeah.,27879.316519999997,27879.556419999994
So you're just gonna have to tap that to make progress.,27879.556419999994,27881.675339999994
"We'll be able to extend it, and then I'll switch this thing down to you.",27881.675339999994,27884.774039999997
Yeah.,27884.793779999996,27885.293779999996

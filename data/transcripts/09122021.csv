"During this time, Tom will tether to the FPMU and begin driving bolts.",2877.27,2882.72998
Two outer and then one center with the pistol grip tool.,2883.43,2887.02502
He'll stow that and then install a handling aid called a scoop for ease and removal of this unique orbital replacement unit or o r u.,2887.325,2895.84

There's not a separate cutout for it.,17821.69498,17823.29498
You'll just have to flip it in through one of the slots.,17823.29498,17826.03497
Okay.,17830.29,17830.79
"So I don't know if it's just in, like, beach, though.",17831.41,17834.47

Doesn't reach out.,17849.44,17850.24002
It doesn't reach there.,17850.24002,17851.46002
So I have to remove all this and go underneath.,17858.76,17860.7
That's fine.,17861.64,17862.38
Yeah.,17863.0,17863.24002

"Yeah, Akie.",17872.075,17872.475
You may need to try the other side.,17872.475,17874.73502
"In order to get the pip in to reach, it only goes one way.",17876.31,17880.41
Yeah.,17882.375,17882.61502
There's no other side to hit.,17882.61502,17884.23502
Look it out from the top.,17884.93503,17886.315
It's the only one.,17886.77502,17887.83502
Please hold.,17888.61502,17889.355
So I tried to work it through the closer cut out.,17889.575,17893.62
And it's not repaired if you try that.,17895.6,17897.6
I can I can come through here maybe That's that means I'm not sure?,17897.6,17903.345

"Well, it's gonna be a nightmare to If you go out there, I try again.",17913.75,17917.905
So how do we try this first?,17918.36505,17920.465
I wanna make sure you do the pit pin before installing the MLI.,17928.27,17932.77
Okay.,17938.955,17939.455
That looks good to us.,17942.03,17943.49005

M l MLI may not reach That's good.,17947.95,17950.685
I do concern.,17950.685,17951.505
Okay.,17952.685,17953.185
That's supposed to go over the bolt for that.,17958.66,17960.66
Yeah.,17960.66,17961.16
Alright.,17964.74,17965.24

Yeah.,17976.83,17977.15
"So, yeah, it's up to one fender.",17977.15,17979.89

So do you see the system going above the NII right here?,18023.439999,18026.74
"If we try if we go above the NOI, like, like, this is happening here, then AC doesn't have enough slack because it's it's effectively blocking the NOI here and we lose some length.",18027.095,18035.915
Right?,18036.41,18036.89
"So the other option is I go under the MLI, bring me back to undo all this NOI until here, and then routes to fifty Looks like a only chance to get, the other end of the NOI engaged over the bolt.",18036.89,18053.204998
Yeah.,18053.204998,18053.704998

"Well, that's what I was trying to call you.",18096.22,18098.24
Are you happy with with me doing that?,18099.135,18101.055

"To my have next steps and an answer for you on the suit, for now, Shane.",17022.78,17027.68
What we are going to do is have you return to the airlock at this time and connect to the SCU for a warm restart.,17029.155,17037.655
"Then we can assess the sublimator pe issue, but we think that that will at least help us diagnose and get a good feel for exactly what's happening with your DCM.",17038.86,17047.36

"Hey, Tamara.",17132.49002,17133.05002
"We'll take a actually, we could take right here.",17133.05002,17134.935
So Houston's station on one.,17134.935,17137.03497
Just wanna make sure we're in sync.,17137.655,17139.175
We're gonna go ahead and execute step twelve of the robo procedure.,17139.175,17142.155
To get Thumba to thyrosa's zenith manual maneuver or thyrosa's zenith position and wanna check with you all before we press.,17142.68,17150.94
Yes.,17155.345,17155.50497

"We'll have you finish up eleven and twelve, that would have us in a good position if we were, needing to execute any additional steps to assist Shane.",17157.82498,17165.63
"But for now, that also puts you in a good position to continue procedures, nominal procedures, and Shane will go back to the airlock.",17165.63,17172.225
We'll get them on the SU.,17172.54498,17173.745
We're gonna check out a restart on the DCM.,17173.745,17176.32498
"And, and we'll go from there.",17176.78,17177.82
"So we think that puts us in the best config to, sort out the problem and then decide if we're gonna carry on.",17177.82,17183.42
Shane will be in a safe place.,17183.42,17185.04

Is that correct?,17203.89502,17204.635
Or climb down on a on our cedar card?,17206.215,17208.795
"You would, provide this GCA and then egress the APFR in order to assist EV two.",17209.48,17214.78

"Comfortable with your current position, with your DCM.",18086.98,18090.840004
We did see a spike in sublimator pressure.,18091.700005,18094.28001
"We're looking at the data now and still analyzing whether we wanna push forward with removing the, IRosa from the FSE.",18094.555,18102.335

"So we're still looking at that, and we'll keep you updated.",18104.49,18107.149994
"For now, with a good config on your DCM, we're gonna have you head back out to the work site.",18107.53,18112.67
Great.,18115.005,18115.245
Copy that.,18115.245,18116.145

"On, his extra vehicular mobility unit space suit, providing suit data for him while he's outside of the International Space Station, You're looking at a view from Kimbro's helmet camera as he, will now remove the umbilical that he hooked himself up, to a moment ago for the restart of that, so called DCM, which is the acronym for display control module.",18132.395,18155.375
"The other issue that we're taking a look at is pressure in the suit's sublimator, which, provides the proper cooling for the space suit.",18155.835,18165.875
"There was a momentary blip in data, a short time ago, and that's, under analysis by engineers here in Mission Control, And that will be a determinant factor in whether we proceed in removing the IRosa solar array from its flight support structure on the trust of the station.",18165.875,18183.825
"This view of Shane Kimbrough now reemerging from the airlock, and he will go, out to the, support structure on the port trust of the station to rejoin to a mob Pesque and await further words from the flight control team here in Houston.",18205.355,18219.99501

"One was the loss of data on his display control module, which is essentially a data box on his space suit that provides information about the condition of his suit systems.",20065.365,20076.91
"The other issue was a Momuntary blip in, sublimator pressure, the sublimator being the device in the suit that provides cooling for the crew member while outside in the void of space.",20077.69,20091.88998
Kimbrough was directed by flight controllers here in mission control to return to the Quest Airlock.,20093.63,20098.825
"He, hooked up an umbilical in the crew lock section of Quest, did a restart of his display control module data package, and it came back to life.",20099.20502,20109.3
"And, he recharged his sublimator, and that's seem to stabilize, the situation with, rock solid readings now being received both on suit data and the sublimator in particular.",20109.59998,20121.125
"So, flight director, Ron Spencer, directed, Kimbro to go back outside, rejoin Pesque at the, IRosa array flight support, equipment.",20121.69,20131.725
"And we are now standing by for the release of that, IRosa array from the flight support equipment.",20132.105,20138.125

"With you're on air, there's about an inch to the Internet gap at the bottom.",26920.635,26924.175
"You know, I thought we could play with, but it looks like the cap top.",26924.99,26929.79004
"Well, that's just the the rotating mechanism out there.",26929.79004,26932.85004
Yeah.,26937.10504,26937.185
"It looks like it should fit right in there, slide right in.",26937.185,26940.005
Every time.,26942.7,26943.42
"Thank you, Titting on something up here.",26943.42,26945.36
Why do I?,26945.74,26946.22
I know exactly where it's sitting.,26946.22,26947.5
It's right in front of me.,26947.5,26948.54
Okay.,26948.54,26949.04
So that's that's the guide pin or whatever it's called you're trying to slide into the the the slot.,26949.18,26954.865
Yeah.,26954.925,26955.405
"It's too much to the right, and it's hitting on the wall of the slot.",26955.405,26959.565
"So that's It's quite, and it's, at least, the base the base of the initiative.",26959.565,26963.47
Probably the ground is a good view.,26963.47,26964.99
I had captured.,26964.99,26965.63
Did you confirm that?,26965.63,26966.85
"We copy all for tracking this, Jimmy.",26967.71497,26969.95496
Yeah.,26969.95496,26970.19495
"We're we're seeing what you're seeing, Shane, and we're talking it.",26970.19495,26973.495
We're following along.,26973.555,26974.615
Any information on my account that should be that should be seeing something.,26976.94,26980.22
"Shane, we can't see from your helmet cam in your current position.",26980.22,26983.76
This is sorry.,26985.39496,26986.21497
"Jenny, this is Tamara.",26986.355,26987.475
This is from America.,26987.475,26988.69495
"Tamara, we can't see from your current position.",26988.75494,26990.675
We have a good view from Shane's helmet cam.,26990.675,26993.175
"So what you need to see on my side, what can I do to give you a good view?",26994.87,26998.41
You,26999.67,27000.0
To tilt your head down.,27000.0,27001.5999999
So pitch forward a little bit if you can.,27001.5999999,27003.86
It is serial slot.,27009.605,27011.785
Alright.,27015.844999,27016.244999
That's better.,27016.244999,27016.805
We're looking.,27016.805,27017.544998
You see the smoke jenny?,27020.23,27021.53
"Oh, they're they're checking it.",27022.15,27023.77
We can see vouchers.,27026.765,27027.985
"We can see the alignment feature on the mod kit, the mounting bracket, but we can't see the slot on the arrows or root beam.",27028.125,27035.504997
So what do I need to do to give you if you exist?,27038.01,27040.269997
"Actually, that's good.",27048.714996,27049.434998
That's helping.,27049.434998,27049.995
"Whatever you're doing now, We can now see it.",27049.995,27053.010002
Yep.,27053.010002,27053.510002
"Thanks, Thomas.",27054.530003,27055.170002
Okay.,27055.170002,27055.49
Could you see what's happening?,27055.49,27056.79
The the bracket alignment feature hitting the wall.,27057.57,27061.865
That's locked.,27063.125,27064.105
"And by by pressing the margin, We see that.",27064.645004,27069.54
"Thanks, Thomas.",27069.54,27070.36
We've tried to slide you that as much as we can to to write on your view.,27075.575005,27080.395004
I see there's a there's a lot Copy.,27080.615005,27086.03001
"Guys, we're talking about a plan down here.",27120.87,27123.13
Alright.,27189.59,27189.75
Can you see my safety tether?,27189.75,27191.29001
"You know, that's fine even when I after that hand off.",27193.27,27197.13501
There's no l o c chain.,27197.755,27199.375
I'll take it behind you.,27199.91501,27201.21501
Check your Amazon control.,27204.56,27205.86
Wait a day maybe.,27206.40001,27207.54001
"Right now, I'd like to talk.",27207.76001,27208.88
Could you move to the Miami?,27208.88,27210.26001
Yeah.,27210.96,27211.36
No worries.,27211.36,27212.095
I don't know if you can see it.,27212.41501,27213.955
"Tomorrow, that's a great view that you're giving us right now.",27215.05501,27217.935
We're still talking down here.,27217.935,27219.635
Or maybe?,27229.22,27229.96
"Alright, guys.",27286.67,27287.23
We have a forward plan.,27287.23,27288.43
"We're gonna ask you to take pictures of the misalignment, at a bunch of different angles.",27288.43,27294.165
We really liked the angle.,27294.165,27295.045
"You're giving us now, Tamara, but as many as you can manage, we would really appreciate.",27295.045,27298.42502
"And then at this point, we are going to refold Irosa and redrive.",27298.80502,27302.665
R six and leave it in a folded position.,27303.13,27305.63
"But, Jenny, Copy the plan.",27309.05,27311.195
"It's gonna be difficult for me to take pictures to let go of one hand, and it rosa kind of opens up again.",27311.195,27317.615
"To hold fours back again, see if I can hold it.",27318.16998,27320.65
So it's it's staying here because I'm maintaining it with my two hands.,27320.65,27323.69
I put on a mounting bracket with one of them.,27323.69,27325.94998
I can push it towards the mounting bracket tomorrow.,27326.235,27328.57498
Got it.,27328.715,27329.775
"We copy, Tamara.",27332.155,27333.375
That's right.,27335.72998,27336.21
Picture.,27336.21,27336.71
"This is Mission Control Houston, approaching the six hour mark into, today's spacewalk, Toma Pescay, and Shane Kimbro, have, begun work to attempt to unfold the two halves of the folded IRosa roll up solar array that, has been mounted on a mounting bracket on the base of the p six trust structure.",27337.41,27361.87
"However, they have encountered some interference with a a piece of equipment on that mounting bracket.",27361.87,27369.155
"And so the recommendation is to refold the array back into its folded position and then, bolt it in place to leave it, for further analysis on a subsequent spacewalk.",27369.375,27381.76498
"So we will not be completing all of the work associated with the deployment of this array today that was determined after spending almost an hour troubleshooting a couple of issues with Shane Kimbrough's suit, one with a display control module, basically a data box on his extra vehicular mobility unit suit and a momentary spike and pressure in his cooling mechanism called a sublimator in his suit.",27382.54498,27410.85
His suit has been functioning perfectly since that troubleshooting occurred.,27410.99002,27414.53
"But, we lost time in the process of doing that troubleshooting, and that cost the two space walkers valuable time in being able to complete all of the work for today.",27414.905,27425.1
"When that work will be picked up, will be the subject of further discussions in the next day or so.",27425.72,27431.5
It's my helmet light.,27435.76498,27437.22498
Yeah.,27437.365,27437.76498
And as I'm taking pictures of blocking it.,27437.76498,27440.26498
I think there's a single good one.,27442.55,27444.33002
"I think I could see it here, though.",27445.43,27446.71
They can definitely use that.,27446.71,27448.15
Yeah.,27448.15,27448.65
"Hey, Farm.",27448.995,27449.555
"I'll mention again we had a really good view from your helmet cam, Tamara.",27449.555,27452.69498
Let's start right here.,27452.91498,27454.055
Okay.,27454.115,27454.51498
So first pictures you need.,27454.51498,27457.335
"I use it by night with, night light as I'm working.",27457.78,27461.8
Copy.,27464.795,27465.295
Shane will also get you to look up if you can understand your maintaining control right now.,27466.715,27471.92
"If you can look up so we got a better view of the hinge, that would also be helpful for us.",27471.92,27477.68002
It's good in all the entry.,27477.68002,27479.14
Okay.,27480.49503,27480.815
I got it.,27480.815,27481.295
Awesome.,27481.295,27481.795
"Thank you, Shane.",27514.01996,27514.92
"And, Shane, we'll have you, pitch back again.",27526.62,27529.76
Looking back at the hinge.,27530.78,27532.16003
Just pitch up a little bit.,27532.67505,27534.61505
And then I think we'll have what we need.,27535.875,27537.815
"Once again, we've just crossed the six hour mark into, today's spacewalk, Pescae and Kimbrough attempted to unfold the Irosa solar ray at the mounting bracket at the base of the p six solar ray trust structure to its fully unfolded configuration, but, they have run into a bit of interference with a mechanism on that mounting bracket.",27565.465,27589.355
"And as a result, the recommendation to the crew is to refold the solar array and to, bolt it in place to leave it, for another day",27589.495,27600.0
"When we can, evaluate, not only the timing of the next spacewalk, but exactly what we will, expect to accomplish.",27600.08,27607.8599997
It's not unfolding.,27622.470001,27623.45
"Oh, yes.",27623.91,27624.39
There we go.,27624.39,27625.29
How are you?,27641.375,27646.195
Hold on out here.,27651.31,27658.54
You have a hand on it?,27660.254997,27661.715
No.,27661.934998,27662.434998
I don't.,27662.655,27663.234997
I don't have anything to grab.,27663.375,27664.755
I move little bit closer I can't it.,27666.92,27675.215
Alright.,27683.5,27683.659996
Orlando.,27683.659996,27684.159996
K.,27685.02,27685.52
And now we're gonna go drive r six.,27690.935,27693.034996
"Affirm, Tamara.",27693.975,27694.854996
You can use your APSR if you need to.,27694.854996,27697.095
Let me know when you're ready for settings.,27697.095,27698.955
That will be two day.,27702.340004,27703.56

Big picture.,27783.355,27783.995
Next steps for you guys.,27783.995,27785.355
I see Tama getting in the APFR.,27785.355,27788.0
"Shane, we're gonna have you hold that position to help Tama until he can drive r six and then we're probably going to have you torque down the emboss that you've finger started previously.",27788.86,27798.19499
You'll use your PGT for that shade.,27798.495,27800.67499
Okay.,27802.81499,27803.31499
Is Tamara?,27819.105,27819.765
Don't go back anymore.,27831.025,27832.22499
Any knees and can get to your left.,27832.22499,27834.245
See my six bed of pulling on me.,27834.705,27836.805
Should you real?,27848.58499,27849.325

"Anyone to, to your right?",27856.81,27860.91
Okay.,27862.17502,27862.495
You kinda hit you're hitting it when you come up?,27862.495,27864.755
I don't know if I should have that come up.,27864.895,27866.335
Because it's always pulling me.,27866.335,27867.855
That's good to see.,27867.855,27869.155
Okay.,27869.215,27869.715
It's spoiling me.,27885.92502,27886.98502
Happening before.,27890.62,27891.6
"Oh, it's still killing me.",27965.6,27967.06
Okay.,27967.755,27968.255
I'm sorry.,28018.27,28018.93
Fine of Tom.,28019.23,28020.29

Okay.,28031.28,28031.78
"And, put a waistcoat around that.",28033.6,28035.94
Skeep there maybe.,28037.38498,28038.525

"However, a small interference prevented, a complete unfolding of the array.",28112.6,28118.095
That's as far as we would have gotten anyway with today's spacewalk.,28118.095,28121.39496
Having lost time to troubleshoot some minor issues with Shane Kimbrough's space suit earlier in the day.,28121.83,28129.21
"So, the two crew members have folded up the array and are bolting it in place in a safe configuration, and, where we go from here with the next, Spacewalk in this series to get these solar rays installed and unfurled to begin the augmentation of power to the International Space Station will be a subject to further discussion by mission managers.",28129.835,28152.85504

"Oh, yeah.",29853.39502,29853.975
It's around your camera.,29855.23502,29856.375
Alright.,29860.39,29860.89
It's a couple of twists in there.,29866.87003,29868.385
"This is Mission Control Houston, approaching the six hour forty minute mark in the space walk just to recap.",29868.70502,29874.64502
"Shane Kimbrough and Tomab Pesque placed their Space suits on, internal battery power at seven eleven AM central time, eight eleven AM eastern time today to begin the two hundred thirty ninth spacewalk in support of Space Station Assembly maintenance and upgrades.",29875.265,29891.265
"The focus for today was, the first in an ongoing series of spacewalks to, install and deploy and activate new solar arrays called Irosa's ISS roll out solar arrays to augment six of the eight power channels on the international outpost.",29891.96503,29912.095
"The two crew members worked, to, prepare, the first of the I Irosa arrays and to get it out of a flight support structure on the trust of the International Space Station where it was delivered after its launch two weeks ago on a space cargo vehicle from the Kennedy Space Center.",29912.96,29933.16
"About three hours into the space wall a couple of, minor problems were detected with Shane Kimbrough's space suit, one, was the loss of data on a, display, a controlled unit that provides space walking astronauts insight into, the health of their suits systems He was directed to go back into the airlock, put himself on an umbilical and restart the display unit, and it, has been operating find ever since.",29935.69995,29966.52997
"The other issue, that was addressed, but cost the crew members time outside was, a momentary spike in pressure readings in, Kimbrough's suit sublimator, a cooling unit for his space suit.",29966.91,29981.225
"But it also has stabilized and, caused no further problems during the course of today's excursion.",29981.55,29987.97003
"But all the time that was lost, dealing with Kimbro's suit, resulted in, first of these two IRosa solar array",29989.005,29997.905
"Units, being removed from the flight support system and moved over to the base of the p six truss to a mounting bracket It was, installed on the mounting bracket.",30000.08,30011.054999
"The two crew members, trying to unfold, the boom, basically, the array at self, which is folded in half, but they couldn't unfold it to its full extension, because of an interference problem with a mechanism on that mounting bracket, and so they were directed to refold it and bolt it in place in a safe configuration, which is where they're going to leave it for today.",30011.355,30035.09

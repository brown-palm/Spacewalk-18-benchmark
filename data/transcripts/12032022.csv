You're watching NASA TV.,49.86182,51.641182
Good morning from the International Space Station Flight Control Room at the Johnson Space Center in Houston and Mission Control.,65.411964,71.538124
"As we begin our coverage today of US Space Walk eighty two, You are looking live inside the equipment lock of the Quest Airlock of the International Space Station as the the two astronauts who will venture out side the quest airlock a short time from now.",72.03763,87.09896
"Josh Cassidy, who is on the right side of your screen, wearing the suit, wearing the red stripes, and just hidden from the field of view, Frank Rubio, who's on the left side, being attended to by Koichi Wakata from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, and NASA astronaut Nicole Mann.",87.278625,104.5589
There you see Rubio on the left.,104.5589,106.53816
"Those are our two astronauts for today who will venture outside for a spacewalk expected to last about seven hours, the focus of which will be on the starboard four truss of the International Space Station to install and monitor the deployment of one of the iroses, the ISS rollout solar arrays, one of two that were delivered on a SpaceX cargo Dragon resupply craft last Sunday to the international outpost.",106.59788,133.55287
The spacewalk today is the two fifty six in support of space station assembly maintenance and upgrades.,135.97993,142.19707
"The third spacewalk that is scheduled for expedition sixty eight so far this year, the eleventh out of the International Space Station in twenty twenty two.",142.61661,151.96071
"Casa and Rubio ventured outside back on November fifteenth for a seven hour eleven minute spacewalk in which they installed a so called modification kit, basically a series of brackets on the Starbird six truss of the International Space Station for a future spacewalk in which an irosa and ISS rollout solar array will be installed for the 1b power channel of the International Space Station.",152.41985,180.27327
That 1b channel will be a prime factor in today's spacewalk activities We'll be talking more about that in just a second.,180.61285,187.83879
"The irosa to be unfurled today to work in concert with its legacy solar array on the Starbird four Trust, again delivered last Sunday on a SpaceX cargo Dragon resupply craft will be removed from a flight support structure on the truss of the station.",188.25833,207.34773
"It will be hand carried by Casada who will be affixed in the manipulator foot restraints on the end of the space station robotic arm, the Canadarm two, and transported from the stowage position in which the array is located at the moment over to a bracket that was installed back in March of the International Space Station's Space Walk Array to be installed on the Starboard four truss and then unfurled that ISS roll out solar array to work in concert to augment the electrical output of the Three a power channel of the International Space Station.",207.64732,249.55304
Two zero and number two two.,250.09251,252.83139
We are in the two minute turnaround hold in step twenty.,253.6696,257.84775
Can correct all these good numbers?,262.22397,263.92337
Nicole Mann reading out the space suit readings.,266.50183,269.1208
Back to mission control here in Houston.,269.87982,272.11868
The crew is running about ten minutes ahead of the timeline in their spacewalk preparations.,272.11868,276.85657
"They won't get too much further ahead of the timeline, though, deliberately because all of the spacewalk work today is going to be timed out in explicit choreography to match the time that some of the work has to be done while we're in darkness or eclipse that will match the time for the mounting of the solar array, its electrical connections, and ultimately the demating of one of four electrical connectors for the 1b power channel solar array that we'll talk about in just a second.",277.29495,311.40607
"Just to recap the bidding on the ISS rollout solar arrays, the current, the original solar arrays called the legacy arrays although performing extremely well over the course of time, are showing some signs of degradation as expected.",311.9749,327.16705
"So to ensure sufficient power supply is maintained for the International Space Station, NASA is in the process of augmenting the existing solar arrays and the power channels for the station accompanied by those new solar arrays.",327.835,343.6766
"Ultimately, this will provide about a twenty percent to thirty percent increase in power for space station research and operations.",344.59485,350.89194
"The new arrays, the irosa's two of which have already been installed today will be the third of six currently planned for installation.",351.7298,359.14633
These new arrays will shade slightly over half of the length of the existing arrays and will be connected to the same power system again augmenting and boosting the existing power supply for space station operations.,359.9257,373.74802
"The eight current arrays, the original arrays are currently capable of generating about a hundred sixty watts, kilowatts of power during orbital daytime.",375.247,383.523
"When the station is flying in daylight, Half of that power is stored in the station's batteries for use while the station is in darkness.",383.78262,392.29773
"Each new solar array the iroses will produce more than twenty kilowatts of electricity, eventually totaling about a hundred twenty kilowatts of augmented power during the time the station flies during orbital daylight.",392.91714,405.681
"In addition, the remaining uncovered solar arrays and the partially uncovered original arrays will continue to generate about ninety five kilowatts of power So ultimately, we're gonna wind up with some two hundred fifteen kilowatts or so of power for the International Space Station.",406.3,423.41135
This is going to enable us to increase the amount of research and utilization in the future years of station operations.,423.91086,433.2562
The ISS rollout solar arrays.,434.16483,436.92343
"Again, this is the third in the series of six that are currently planned to be installed.",436.92343,442.82074
The other two arrays that have already been installed are on the port side at the one a and one b power channels.,443.6399,451.7448
Those are the ones that have already been installed.,451.7448,454.32376
"Today, we're operating on the starboard four trusses to install the power the ISS rollout solar array to augment power for the three a power channel.",454.82327,464.0377
"The next spacewalk that is scheduled for Rubio and Casada is planned for December nineteenth that we'll see them duplicate their efforts, that they will undertake today.",464.4972,476.5107
"But this time, on the port four truss of the International Space Station on December nineteenth when they install a roll out solar array for the four a power channel.",476.5107,487.73416
"Now, if time permits at the back end of today's spacewalk activity, The crew will conduct one final important task that being the demating of one of four electrical connectors on the Neighboring starboard six truss where the one b power channel solar array is located.",487.91382,508.37247
"About a week and a half ago, there was a power trip on that solar array very similar to what we saw back in March that reduced the power augmentation capability for the one b solar array.",510.91992,522.823
"Last about ten days ago when the latest power trip occurred, it took down the 1b channel altogether.",523.3625,528.8187
The power output for the systems associated with the 1b channel are currently being taken over by the 1A power channel without any impact to station operations.,529.718,541.0919
Or any research activities aboard the station.,541.58,544.07904
"However, in order to get that 1B power channel back up and running at some seventy five percent of capacity, it will be necessary for Casa da and Rubio to demate one of four electrical connectors very similar to what they'll be demating for the installation of the ISS rollout solar array during today's spacewalk.",544.1787,563.80786
"Once they demate that connector, the one b power channel can be reactivated by the Electrical Systems Officer here in mission control to get back to about seventy five percent of its augmented capability and that will bring the 1B power channel back online, albeit at a slightly degraded state.",564.50726,583.8451
While it awaits the installation of its ISS rollout solar array to be delivered on a SpaceX cargo flight next year.,584.2449,593.54047
If we can't complete either the complete,595.749,599.8472
"Installation and unfurling of the ISS rollout solar array for the three a power channel today or If we can't finish the demating of the electrical connector to enable us to reactivate the 1b power channel, then an additional spacewalk likely would be added this coming Wednesday, December seventh, that would see Casa and Rubio venture outside once again.",600.08002,625.78656
To complete the work that they would not be able to complete at the end of today's excursion.,625.995,630.7728599999999
"However, we're expecting that today's spacewalk to last about seven hours in duration.",631.032481,636.17928
"And at least the plan going in is to get that irosa for the three a power channel fully deployed, fully installed and deployed, and to demate that one electrical connector on the 1b power channel on the Starbird six truss to enable flight controllers to reactivate the 1B power channel and get it up and running to seventy five percent of its operating capability.",636.5988199999999,659.27608
As you watch Koichi Wakada of the Japan Aerospace X operation agency attach the equipment to Josh Cassidy's space suit.,691.72686,700.32255
"He will do the same to Frank Rubio who's on the left side of your screen a short time from now this in preparation for the installation of the SAFER units, the simplified aid for EVA rescue units jet powered backpacks that space walkers wear when they go out into the vacuum of space.",700.32255,718.112624
That enables them in the highly unlikely event they would become untethered to propel themselves back to the safety of structure on the International Space Station.,718.4522,728.30612
"Both crew members will have their safer units attached, and then they will be moved one by one into the back section or the crew lock section of the International Space Station's Quest Airlock, the hatch will be closed, and then plans will begin for the depressurization of the airlock in a two step fashion, down to vacuum, first down to five pounds per square inch of pressure, then down to vacuum.",729.0448299999999,754.0423099999999
"Prior to the time the crew had placed their suits on battery power, to mark the official start of today's spacewalk, a US based spacewalk out of the Quest airlock.",754.58179,764.10727
"It's elapsed time as measured from battery power on for the crew on their space suits to the time they're back inside in, repressurize, begin the repressurization of the airlock.",764.44686,775.5813899999999
Today's spacewalk again very intricate and very well choreographed to see the installation and unfurling of one of the two ISS rollout solar arrays on the three eighths power channel or the starboard four truss of the International Space Station to boost the power capability for that power channel.,777.21979,798.22902
"We have an animation that is narrated by the lead space walk officer today, Chris Mundy, in which he will explain all of the work to be performed outside by Josh Cassidy and Frank Rubio.",798.60858,809.65253
"As the EVA begins, Josh Casada as EV one and the red stripes will egress the airlock first.",813.13914,818.4850899999999
"Followed by EV two, Frank Rubio, with the white stripes.",818.6450199999999,821.94362
They will each grab a bag and then both crew members will translate out to a location on the truss to set up their tethers.,822.4031399999999,827.6999999999999
EV one will head to the irosa carrier that has the stowed solar arrays to begin setting up that worksite.,830.5983,835.5760499999999
By stowing his crew lock bag on a handrail and retrieving his pistol grip tool.,835.67506,839.7732699999999
EV one will then release the first restraint bolt on the irosa.,844.19974,847.6582599999999
"Meanwhile, EV two will head outboard to drop off their cable bag, then retrieve and stow their crew lock bag at the three a irosa mod kit.",852.97501,860.4714999999999
"Back at the irosa carrier, EV one will retrieve an articulating portable foot restraint and install it on the end of the space station's EV one ingresses that foot restraint, providing a stable platform to allow the irosa to be carried from the carrier out to the mod get installation location Once complete at the mod get, EV two translates inboard and begins preparing the iRO for removal from the carrier.",870.09506,903.0645999999999
"First, EV two will release two anti rotation devices from the carrier.",903.28424,907.4623999999999
These devices secure the primary straight bolt during the high vibration load seen during launch.,907.9218999999999,912.6490799999999
EV two will then partially release the primary strength bolts and install the first of two handling aids called SCOOPs in preparation for removing the irosa from the carrier.,916.98666,926.1123299999999
"On the robotic arm, EV one will fly over to access two sets of bolts on the boom end of the irosa.",941.42364,947.04108
The first two bolts will allow the boom deployment system rollers to be moved into place later helping the arrays during deployment.,947.5499599999999,954.40676
The second two bolts really two of four mechanisms holding the irosa in its rolled up configuration.,955.3860199999999,960.39346
"The robotic arm will then fly EV one over to the other side of the irosa, and both crew members will work together to release the final bolt holding irosa to the carrier.",963.2518,972.08511
They will then install a second scoop and then lift irosa off of the carrier.,975.0836199999999,979.54162
"After several maneuvers on the robotic arm, EV one will arrive at the mod kit worksite.",992.8033599999999,997.38132
"During these maneuvers, EV two will reconfigure e Goodbye.",997.67999,1000.81869

So they should not be the ones logging it.,10386.10202,10388.24119

No way for me.,10479.05818,10480.077940000001
"Hey, Nick.",10480.977260000001,10481.377040000001

"There's a it's a label, and there's a left label and a right label.",10508.32962,10511.94806

Checking.,10518.374380000001,10518.874380000001
"That's the case, Frank.",10521.25293,10522.172480000001
We're gonna need to translate your way about a half inch I don't know how that makes sense with your watch.,10522.172480000001,10527.41918
"Well, right now, that would make sense actually which I have it back towards you a little bit.",10529.23803,10533.03613

So that is that arrow is not at the hinge.,10543.69928,10547.077850000001
Hinge is gonna be about an inch by direction.,10547.897180000002,10550.716030000001
On that arrow.,10551.625080000002,10552.5249
Okay.,10553.62411,10554.12411

"Yeah, Joshua.",10565.965080000002,10566.74496
That arrow should line up dead center with the hinge.,10566.88464,10569.70348
"Hey, Next.",10573.370050000001,10573.929750000001

That arrow is about right now a half inch towards him.,10590.629120000001,10595.06688
"Meaning, the hinge will be a half inch match it right on the arrow.",10595.06688,10601.0737

It's a great place to do it.,18745.584080000004,18747.243500000004
"Also, much better to be in this position than to be flush to try to beat the phone?",18757.207190000005,18764.573610000007
Yep.,18764.993150000006,18765.273010000004

And people talk through every single scenario.,18773.277770000004,18776.216550000005
Get this window.,18777.364920000007,18778.164500000006
Okay.,18778.164500000006,18778.664500000006

It's on the outside.,18922.829450000005,18923.789000000004
So it's on the very ends of the boom.,18923.789000000004,18925.568350000005
"And it's it's rolled flat, and you'll see them fold back and and make a tube and It's the it's the thing we kept the yellow in action not to touch that has some of the the white skirt.",18926.347700000006,18938.650220000007

And and the crew will release a pair of launch restraint bolts.,19006.459300000006,19009.877860000004
And then the stored energy in that rolled up solar array will be released and it should unfurl.,19010.177450000007,19016.944080000005
"It will take a few minutes to unfurl to its full length of sixty feet at which point Josh Cassidy will drive and release, actually, a pair of bolts to tension the blanket.",19017.443560000007,19029.146870000004

Do you want me to kind of go in the middle of it?,19049.903300000005,19051.902330000004
"Or We'd we'd like you to work inboard I'm sorry, outboard of the the mod kit.",19051.902330000004,19064.624500000005
So you're gonna translate further outboard.,19064.624500000005,19066.683730000004
Correct.,19072.300130000007,19072.659930000005

"From my vantage point, it looks like on this side, Auto magnets are aligning and flipping them properly all the way at least for fifteen, twenty feet.",19557.737760000004,19567.301990000004
"That's great to hear, Frank.",19569.888990000003,19571.008440000005
Thanks for the words.,19571.008440000005,19572.028180000005
This is mission control Houston.,19681.793840000006,19683.433000000005
"The new ISS rollout solar ray doing just what its name implies, rolling out to its full length of sixty feet that began about five minutes ago.",19683.433000000005,19695.315930000004
"Well, that's really speechless, but this will do it.",19696.085160000006,19700.503220000006
That's pretty cool.,19702.761830000003,19703.821560000004
Pretty I'm giving you to back off the duty gear.,19707.988260000006,19711.486740000004
And Josh Frank.,19718.421960000003,19719.290120000005
We've got a few minutes here as it finishes the deployments and then we tighten everything back up and start cleaning up.,19719.290120000005,19725.267410000004
Wanted to give you some big picture words and then figure out the get some input from you on the way forward because we do have a little bit of time before the next clips where we're gonna go after that one bravo.,19725.327100000006,19735.139460000006
Okay.,19740.036820000005,19740.536820000005
Yeah.,19742.564710000006,19742.844560000005
So big picture consumables are looking great.,19742.844560000005,19745.563160000005
Time line is looking great.,19745.563160000005,19747.022720000004
So we're not facing any limits there.,19747.961990000003,19750.700860000004
"We've been scratching our heads on the the things that Josh might be able to do while, Frank, while you're out working the the one bravo.",19751.939760000005,19758.656360000004
So that would involve going back to the FSC and releasing bolts one through four r one through r four.,19758.656360000004,19768.681410000005
And and no need to do any kind of socket swap or anything.,19769.360160000004,19773.398160000004
We'd have you drop a crew lock bag off on the the seated cart on your way.,19773.398160000004,19777.536360000006
"And but that would put Josh, I'd put you at the FSC while Frank's getting in position out at one bravo.",19777.885210000004,19784.462160000003
I just wanna check and see how you guys are feeling.,19784.681860000004,19786.870320000005
Be good with that plan.,19786.910290000003,19788.010030000005
Ground here to support.,19789.149160000004,19790.248860000003
"So you're broken, but I don't understand the caution is that we're comfortable with leaving a debt, but if you do",19793.874960000005,19800.000320000003

"You were a little broken, but, yeah, that's the question.",19810.37364,19812.37264
Are you guys good with the split?,19812.37264,19813.952100000002
I'm okay with it.,19818.29832,19819.477980000003
Take how long of a trans Yes.,19820.657138000002,19823.665000000005
If if we need to do it quickly.,19823.665000000005,19825.484340000003
Seems like it would be ten fifteen.,19826.983340000002,19831.281440000002
Okay.,19833.009660000003,19833.489418
Yeah.,19833.489418,19833.68932
We think five to ten.,19833.68932,19834.728797000003
I think ten.,19834.728797000003,19837.907460000002
"Well, Frank, if you are comfortable with it and we can go ahead and just talk through the route that I would take to get out to you.",19841.21408,19848.510322000002
"We've already thought Drew, if there's no questions, then I would be I'd be comfortable with that.",19848.550304000004,19853.727962000004
Okay.,19857.275120000002,19857.714900000003

K.,19862.992260000003,19863.492260000003
"Nick, I think I can picture a lot of the handrails for me to get out there.",19865.660200000002,19870.797880000002
"Obviously, feet from the FRC going under the MT, going under the service seat occurred.",19872.057000000004,19876.573500000002
"Going across the surge, Should I stay stationed forward or what I Yeah.",19877.592735000002,19886.706940000004
Yep.,19892.363655,19892.643516000004
That would work.,19892.643516000004,19893.503340000003
"And I don't know if you have it up in front of you, but would it be the same same path I took before?",19899.540020000004,19904.677700000004
I know we've changed the configuration of the station.,19904.697440000004,19906.956565000004
"Like they were hammering, like, two two two two now that I was on the right way after crossing the search.",19909.094380000002,19915.520324000005
"And, Josh, we're track we're we're talking to?",19919.718220000002,19921.937360000004
Yeah.,19948.02025,19948.300110000004
"Copy, Josh.",19948.300110000004,19949.019760000003
It'd be nadir four hundred forward corner all the way to the FSC or all the way out.,19949.019760000003,19954.297120000003
I'm sorry.,19954.297120000003,19954.95703
Okay.,19957.764010000003,19958.264010000003
"And that was a pretty clean task, if I'm not mistaken.",19958.523620000004,19961.062610000004
"It's a straight line shot, and it's per what we had sent you in the brief.",19961.402180000005,19964.820720000003

Yep.,19989.887240000004,19990.24705
"And if I had it come to you, I would just follow my other swap, and then hand over to the vehicle.",19990.24705,19996.913480000003
Okay.,19996.913480000003,19997.413480000003
"Hey, Nick.",20003.72948,20004.169270000002
"If we end up going that route, you need one and EV two again?",20004.169270000002,20008.067570000003
Yep.,20014.034010000003,20014.393840000004
"Copy, Josh.",20014.393840000004,20015.213680000004
Appreciate you guys talking through that.,20015.4733,20017.812380000003
We're tracking along.,20017.832120000003,20018.930320000003

"And so if the situation changes, if we feel like we wanted just stop and call today.",20024.807370000002,20030.154690000003
You guys have crushed it up to this point.,20030.154690000003,20031.953800000003
This is all extra in length to have things.,20031.953800000003,20034.09297
Sounds great.,20038.399510000003,20039.279070000004
And this this piece of luck was crushed.,20039.279070000004,20043.357020000003
We certainly didn't do it by ourselves.,20043.357020000003,20045.096400000002
The new ISS rollout solar array now fully deployed to its length of sixty feet.,20053.500020000003,20059.237380000002
The deployment took about nine minutes to complete.,20059.77687,20062.27586
"Oh, gosh.",20063.80482,20064.54472
The deployment or the unfurling of the array began at eleven thirty seven AM central time.,20066.723370000003,20072.86055
And was complete about two minutes ago.,20073.150120000002,20075.449220000002
Drive the tensionable.,20075.54892,20076.48872
Two bolts now will be driven to tension the array.,20076.82829,20080.806560000005
And then all of the irosa work will be complete.,20081.455180000004,20084.413720000004
Go ahead.,20084.413720000004,20086.11312
Sounds good.,20087.69206,20088.551890000002
Is it okay next and I'll go ahead and take it.,20089.819900000002,20094.118000000002
I was gonna say your your settings for the PGT or alpha one counter two.,20094.2177,20099.324940000002
Alpha one.,20103.702500000003,20104.38216
Correct.,20104.38216,20104.82194
"So the new ISS a solar array joins the original array, delivered to the space station at the starboard four truss more than fifteen years ago, to augment the power capability and output for the three a power channel on the International Space Station.",20104.82194,20121.682140000004
Let me see if I can pull up on whatever it takes.,20123.259820000003,20125.359020000004
Josh Cassidy will move towards the likelihood of get ahead work to release four bolts on the other ISS rollout solar array that was delivered on the SpaceX cargo Dragon resupply flight a week ago at the International Space Station.,20139.238920000003,20159.558360000003
That array or rollout solar array is due to be released and transported to the port for truss of the station for installation and deployment on December nineteenth.,20159.97792,20172.701770000003
And another spacewlog plan for Casa da and Rubio.,20173.300280000003,20176.239060000004
This would be get ahead work to release the first four bolts that are holding that second ISS roll out solar array to its flight support equipment.,20176.658620000002,20186.343320000004
Thank you for the reminder.,20189.0417,20190.261340000005
And Does this one pop out?,20190.960740000002,20193.449720000004
It will spring out when fully released.,20194.508920000004,20196.84802

"Meanwhile, we're about forty two minutes from entering the next eclipse period in darkness for the station.",20202.39467,20208.531840000003
At which time Frank Rubio will be at the starboard six truss and will work to demate one of four electrical connectors for the one b power channel solar array that experienced an electrical trip We're taking down that one b power channel about ten days ago.,20209.080220000003,20232.788040000003
The loads for generation of electricity for station systems through the 1B channel were seamlessly transferred over to the 1A power channel but to regain the 1b power channel capability at a somewhat reduced efficiency of about seventy five percent of capacity one electrical cable needs to be demated to isolate the affected area of that array.,20232.788040000003,20256.883070000003
"Rubio will demate the one electrical connector and the electrical systems specialists here in mission control will reactivate the 1B power channel bringing it back into operation, albeit at seventy five percent of rated performance.",20257.38258,20273.742820000003
Okay.,20274.002420000004,20274.502420000004

Ready to go here?,20354.721920000004,20355.78162
Alright.,20361.817890000002,20362.317890000002
You wanna give me a rep?,20367.054460000003,20368.833820000003
Yep.,20369.253320000003,20369.753320000003
I think I understand that we can go ahead and be the adjustables from the cables and then Brett to the adjustable itself.,20370.432720000004,20384.66469
Affirmative.,20385.683920000003,20386.183920000003

Not right.,20775.532370000004,20775.932180000003
So I'll go this way.,20775.932180000003,20777.151820000003
"Like, you wanna talk me on to This is mission control.",20779.759180000005,20784.117000000006
"Houston, five hours, forty four minutes into today's SpaceWALK.",20784.117000000006,20787.525420000005
"The irosa, the ISS rollout, Solar Array, launched a week ago, along with a companion irosa, on the SpaceX cargo Dragon resupply craft to the International Space Station, the irosa earmarked to augment power for the 3A power channel on the Starboard four truss of the International Space Station has been installed and fully unfurled generating perfect electrical power in one of the smooth operations seen in recent spacewalking history by Casada and Rubio.",20788.664600000004,20822.894920000002
"Took about nine minutes for the jury to fully unfurl once its final launch restraint bolts were backed away slowly, but surely it moved to its fully unfilled position, and then a pair of bolts were driven to tension the blanket.",20826.073080000006,20843.002820000005
And the Electrical Systems Officer here in Mission control reported a short time ago that the newly installed irosa is generating perfect electrical output.,20843.582300000005,20854.236660000002
Okay.,20855.955220000003,20856.315020000005
"So I'll just start adding out towards With that having been completed, Frank Rubio will soon make his way to the adjacent starboard six truss to demate once we can move into an eclipse period into orbital sunset About thirty minutes from now, he will demate one electrical cable for the one b solar.",20856.315020000005,20879.731960000005
Array's electrical power channel.,20880.750240000005,20883.569080000005
"The one b power channel experienced power trip about ten days ago that took the power channel down, power output for station systems through the one b channel.",20885.907650000005,20897.251760000003
"Seamlessly transferred over to the one a power channel, but to reinstate power capability for the one b channel, One of four power connectors will be demated that will isolate the affected area of the one b solar array on the Starbird six truss that will enable flight controllers here to reactivate the 1b channel, albeit at about seventy five percent of working capacity.",20897.490380000003,20924.496120000003
"Meanwhile, Josh Casado will do one get ahead task.",20925.325320000004,20929.183620000003
That will be the release of four initial bolts for the other ISS rollout solar array that's on a flight support structure on the truss of the station on the Port Ford truss.,20929.563220000004,20941.286820000005
That will buy a little bit of time on December nineteenth when this pair of astronauts goes back out to install the next ISS rollout solar array.,20941.995420000003,20951.690820000003
"On the port four truss, well, the four a power channel.",20952.100320000005,20955.958670000004
About five panels.,20956.058320000004,20957.357960000005
Five of those solar panels up in the middle.,20957.417660000003,20959.896420000005
You see two kind of white ribbons.,20959.896420000005,20961.735020000004
There's a irregularity in the white ribbons.,20961.754750000004,20963.873720000003
That's a shade.,20963.873720000003,20965.533120000004
If you can take a picture of everything around that That'd be great.,20965.752720000004,20969.910220000005
We just need a handful of pictures though.,20970.249720000003,20972.468920000003
"And, Frank, if I'm not a a broad And, Frank, if you move a little bit further outboard, you might be able to see between the legacy arrays through the launch around.",20982.223720000005,20997.384520000003
We're just looking at that theme between the,20997.764020000002,20999.793390000003
I don't I don't wanna see what you're looking forward.,21071.289705000007,21074.128280000004
Can you guys see it on the head count?,21074.128280000004,21075.787706000006

And so remember how this mechanism works.,10224.744799,10227.063639
You're gonna engage the left side first.,10227.063639,10229.16284
Thank you for having to drop it down to engage it if it doesn't slide all the way in.,10229.342499,10233.28956
"It's up and down a little bit till that you engage, and then you're gonna pivot it to the right to engage the soft dock.",10233.28956,10239.38676
"Jeremiah, can you please explain to us what photovoltaic technology lead is?",10243.193283,10249.17054
Handrail twenty Certainly.,10249.54996,10250.80958
"I I'm the full year technology lead at NASA Glyn research center, where we do a lot of research and development efforts.",10251.149162,10258.00598
For new photovoltaic devices through arrays.,10258.374943,10261.513622
And my role as this type of thing is to oversee all of the projects that we have that we're working on.,10261.97314,10268.24
"Look for new ideas and new concepts to start to pursue in the future, and then support flight missions such as what's happening with the irosa arrays and with gateway and ARTEMIS to photovoltaic systems on the lunar surface.",10268.55984,10284.5613
That is amazing.,10285.65958,10286.53914
And you did mention just now the high voltage solar arrays.,10286.53914,10289.83774
Why are they important technology for us right now?,10290.817,10293.39596
Rosa and the irosa arrays are super important.,10294.94466,10298.20328
"As you said at the beginning, they're going to add more power to the space station.",10298.58284,10302.0611
Yeah.,10302.0611,10302.51
The ROSA arrays were developed over the past ten years or so.,10302.86982,10308.16742
"And we've seen in the past couple of years, demonstration on space station, and they were just used on the dart mission.",10308.507,10316.072685
And the benefits of ROSA is that you can store a lot more solar array in a much smaller package.,10316.492226,10322.578766
So the arrays that are being deployed with irosa are about twenty kilowatts each.,10323.11825,10329.54393
And they're stowed in one very small compact rolled tube.,10329.88351,10334.4215
That can then be put into different commercial resupply vehicles.,10334.7999,10338.29839
So much easier way to get a lot of power up into space.,10338.47806,10341.96501
We're going to continue that when we use them on gateway on the power propulsion element and and also it may be on the lunar surface.,10342.56471,10351.82033
Okay.,10354.66866,10355.10843
"Copy, Roger.",10355.10843,10356.02797
Good job on getting that soft dock.,10356.02797,10357.86705
I've got some PGT settings for you when you're ready.,10357.86705,10361.0857
"That's awesome, Jeremiah.",10364.41377,10365.59343
And I know you mentioned the gateway.,10365.89304,10367.972
Can you explain a little bit about gateway and how the technology that you guys are looking at now will help for future exploration in deep space.,10367.972,10375.88757
Certainly.,10377.06673,10377.56673
"So first, I talked a little bit about rose that I Rosa to gateway.",10378.22615,10382.15425
Okay.,10382.37389,10382.65375
And then it's gonna The I Rosa arrays are around twenty kilowatt each.,10382.65375,10387.91138
The arrays that are going to be on gateway on the power and propulsion element are thirty kilowatts each.,10388.46983,10393.72746
"So a little bit larger, about fifty percent larger in size And what's really unique and what's different between what's happening on space station and what's going to happen on gateway is that when the power and propulsion element of gateway is launched, those arrays will open autonomously.",10393.78717,10410.54872
They'll open on their own.,10410.80835,10412.18791
"Currently, what people are seeing right now on space station is and the adapter bracket is being installed and installation bracket.",10412.44753,10419.81349
"And then later on when those irosa rays make it up to space station, they will be deployed with support of the astronauts.",10419.95317,10427.3587
"For Gateway, they'll be deployed on their own and will provide power throughout that mission.",10428.53786,10433.59558
The power and propulsion element is just one of the different components of gateway.,10434.84457,10438.38306
"There's also going to be other modules that will attach to it And while that's orbiting the moon, it's going to be a great stopping point and a stepping off point for astronauts to go to the lunar surface.",10438.64267,10451.31503
To continue to do research on the moon and then also eventually be able to be used to let us go further out to go to Mars and continue to explore this solar system.,10451.51494,10461.61865
Howard Bauchner: And that's amazing.,10461.61865,10465.7366

I'm thinking all the integrators are there.,21321.824620000003,21323.883840000002
Yeah.,21329.519400000005,21330.019400000005

Yeah.,21336.435940000003,21336.715820000005

Stop back in the bag.,21414.127990000005,21415.427620000002
Did you do that?,21416.926600000003,21417.826420000005
I'm a go pro back in.,21418.485800000002,21419.865380000003
Assume this black bag and then wind up back on my BRT.,21435.524500000003,21438.463280000004
Okay.,21440.601980000003,21441.101980000003

And so you can start working on that.,21448.387540000003,21451.346060000003
If you can spare some some brain bytes to listen to this the big picture we're looking at.,21451.346060000003,21456.742950000003
So a bolt breaking torque on the bolt on the three alpha I e a.,21457.722220000003,21461.929650000002
"We'll move to that get ahead, and then we'll move to the one alpha bolts as well.",21462.449400000005,21468.546600000005
And then that's about an hour's worth of task and that still leaves us about twenty minutes to do AMS.,21468.686270000002,21473.873420000004
So how are you guys feeling about that?,21474.37292,21476.312190000004
"We're feeling good about that plan, and maybe we could just check-in after the three alphas for making the call to go to one alpha, but Raj and I are best doing good.",21480.258520000003,21488.713280000004

We're gonna head over toward AMS from here.,26028.408890000002,26031.587540000004
And so both of you find a place to attempt to stow those bags.,26032.80669,26035.465610000003
"And then, Kayla is gonna translate to the s three trust beam.",26036.544700000002,26043.24159
Now five hours and thirty two minutes into today's spacewalk recapping some of the milestones at seven twelve AM central time.,26044.679260000004,26052.24491
"Eight to twelve AM eastern time, NASA astronauts, Kayla Barron and Raja Chari turned their seats onto battery power, marking the official start of today's spacewalk.",26052.404830000003,26061.620450000002
There.,26062.279780000004,26062.779780000004
They then translated to the Starboard Fortress work site where they successfully installed a three a modification kit for future I ruxo or ISS rollout solar arrays.,26063.199340000003,26076.012580000002
They then completed multi layer installation tiebacks and began to work on key heads at the three a integrated assembly.,26079.939640000004,26094.631500000003
Integrated electronic electronic assembly.,26095.149840000002,26097.64884
"They completed this task and now are heading, translating to the AMS or electromagnetic spectrometer for patch panel access evaluations.",26098.268280000004,26107.492580000002
Near five three seven zero.,26108.271940000002,26109.971350000003
Is where you use in terms of the crew lock bag.,26110.939700000003,26112.998900000002
"Plus this offer PRT, but got it still near five three one zero.",26188.414380000002,26193.711980000004
A bag?,26194.251440000004,26194.831380000003
Copy the strut back near five three one zero.,26196.969820000002,26199.428880000003
"And when you guys are ready, Kayla, you can lead translate to the s three trust beam location near s three with twenty eight, and you're getting set up to monitor Raja.",26200.608000000004,26212.612250000002
K.,26217.128240000002,26217.328160000005
And a warning Are you gonna have to push those bags?,26217.328160000005,26220.067020000002
"Or do you before it goes, Venus, just side around?",26220.994940000004,26223.65388
"Yep, sir.",26224.353280000003,26224.793030000004
And then you can push them back to get them out of your way.,26224.793030000004,26227.35175
Okay.,26227.35175,26227.85175
Okay.,26231.229010000003,26231.729010000003
"And warning and treatment hazard, we're going up toward a confined space under the Ford AMS radiator.",26232.228520000004,26237.60608
So just be careful.,26237.94565,26238.96538
And then also avoid contact with the ACC cable and tracker flat cables inside the AMS work site.,26239.144900000003,26246.121680000004
"And if you don't have a picture of that in your cuff, I can talk you on once we get up there.",26246.779780000004,26250.917980000002
"Like, I'm caught on something.",26276.534120000004,26277.853460000002
The other looks Is it my real standard?,26277.853460000002,26282.951140000005
That's cost us.,26287.488080000003,26288.827640000003
People are unwinding.,26290.646480000003,26292.06604
Your green hook's running down here.,26293.424880000002,26295.124280000004
Call the fog.,26297.262940000004,26298.202730000005
"Oh, see if it's not done anything.",26299.701720000005,26301.061080000003
Just to see I'm ruling.,26301.061080000003,26302.24072
Can I read something else?,26302.729860000003,26304.34931
Let me get a better view of you.,26304.528960000003,26306.188380000003
"I don't see anything, but Cool.",26307.607420000004,26310.654730000002
Pretty hard resistance to the towards the corner.,26310.654730000002,26313.45328
You can bend towards your tether.,26313.45328,26314.772650000003
Okay.,26314.772650000003,26315.272650000003
I think You're coming.,26321.168480000004,26324.686680000003
Okay.,26324.686680000003,26325.186680000003
You think they got diet pressure?,26329.204180000004,26331.083280000003
Okay.,26331.083280000003,26331.583280000003
Maybe it's a PPT guy at ELC field.,26331.72288,26333.902080000003
I think it might have been the ELC above my helmet.,26341.077180000004,26343.914920000003
Yeah.,26343.994880000002,26344.27472
"So right now, like, the second of your PGT is static.",26344.27472,26348.472680000003
It was inside.,26348.472680000003,26349.072330000003
You'll see two fifty two going.,26349.072330000003,26350.351680000003
Those directions are going.,26350.351680000003,26351.271240000002
That's just clear.,26351.271240000002,26352.210980000003
"Again, the crew has completed breaking slash resetting torque on the three a, or pro replacement units and is transitioning to the AMS or the Alpha magnetic spectrometer, pitch panel, fit check test.",26356.338380000005,26369.34068
Further inboard.,26375.137280000003,26375.957080000004
Once Kayla is in a good position.,26377.184780000003,26379.203980000002
Okay.,26384.879780000003,26385.199580000004
"And then obtain a a body position for monitoring Roger's clearances, and then you can give Roger a go to approach AMS.",26385.199580000004,26392.056480000003
Do you have a go to a pro camera?,26394.334720000003,26396.034120000004
K.,26396.053880000003,26396.553880000003
That might be the little bit of a GCA here to see you all coming.,26397.173280000003,26399.999820000005
Let's take it off top.,26400.439600030004,26401.699220100003
Copy.,26402.358640200004,26402.858640200004
"And, Roger, you're gonna translate to the Forward Nader AMS worksite.",26403.278180100006,26406.616760500005
And then you might consider climbing up the seat of cart as an option.,26409.774040000004,26414.531660000004
So there's a handrail here.,26414.531660000004,26416.010920000004
Okay.,26416.010920000004,26416.450700000005
So I'm on.,26416.450700000005,26417.230560000004
"There's there's one when I get up here, a good point.",26418.599620000005,26421.138600000006
It's a lot of these at IVs.,26427.684503000004,26428.963863000004
"So if you have your power right, I can get over to that from here.",26428.963863000004,26431.742723000003
You're done?,26434.161260000004,26434.861163000005
I think I wanna come towards you on this diagonal piece.,26451.221866000004,26454.060443000006
Right?,26454.060443000006,26454.560443000006
Okay.,26456.059420000005,26456.339282000004
And then there's a small handrail.,26456.339282000004,26458.198604000005
Do you cross the next step?,26461.656623000006,26463.236083000003
And can I just slow your rate a little?,26464.444800000005,26468.183180000004
Or And nice job.,26468.242900000005,26469.782380000004
"Both of you, but we're gonna hold before we ingress.",26469.802120000004,26473.420560000006
The AMS works side.,26473.480280000003,26474.609680000005
So we're gonna hold the gear shortly.,26474.609680000005,26477.288340000003
Let me go local down.,26477.288340000003,26480.467000000004
I rotate on facing port.,26481.046466000003,26483.425525000006
Physician?,26483.884715000004,26484.384715000004
Yes.,26485.363980000006,26485.563880000005
How many It's barely kicking down the line.,26485.563880000005,26493.118850000006
Good.,26493.658336000004,26494.158336000004
"And there's another short handrail on the at the side of that same beam, a little to your right.",26494.737796000005,26500.673335000003
Yeah.,26500.673335000003,26500.793280000005
"Before I rotate, let me get a look of that.",26500.793280000005,26502.272540000005
I was just realizing there's nothing for me to stop the momentum.,26502.272540000005,26505.211314000004
Yeah.,26505.589780000006,26506.089780000006
Local and your end effector would be good?,26506.349390000003,26508.968330000003
And watch your foot.,26515.864080000003,26517.383310000005
K.,26517.383310000005,26517.883310000005
As you have your fingers.,26519.222390000006,26521.041736000003
"If your feet kick off, your push the back your push in SAFR to contact the bottom of AMS.",26521.181415000003,26527.717360000006
You keep your feet down?,26529.096410000006,26530.435990000005
Can I relocate then?,26541.858770000006,26543.278310000005
"I I thought it was a standby, I think.",26545.177100000004,26547.336020000006
Alright.,26547.336020000006,26547.615880000005
I'll show you.,26547.615880000005,26548.624800000005
"Hey, firm.",26549.104570000003,26549.584320000005
We're gonna hold here.,26549.584320000005,26550.663790000006
Thank you.,26550.663790000006,26551.363680000006
Yeah.,26556.779330000005,26557.019220000006
"And just in general, so when we get in there and start looking around, we've got some time here to hold the recording exercise constraints but just big picture before we get in there.",26557.019220000006,26566.523960000006
Main thing that I'm thinking about this whole time is you're not getting stuck.,26566.663640000006,26570.101920000005
"So as we move in, we wanna make sure that we can get back out And there's quite a few no touch things in there.",26570.101920000005,26576.038640000006
I think you have a picture in your cuff.,26576.038640000006,26577.818010000006
All of it is covered by white MOI.,26577.957690000003,26579.817000000003
So it all looks the same.,26579.916710000005,26581.975920000004
And some of them are things we can lightly touch and some are absolute no touches.,26582.504620000003,26586.102830000003
And so let's just go real slow and real steady so we don't hurt AMS.,26586.102830000003,26590.920670000003
"And I think in this position, I can see that ACC cable.",26593.868670000003,26596.847430000005
That's terrible.,26597.386920000004,26598.206760000005
"Thanks, Ashley.",26598.884680000003,26599.704520000003
Your helmet needed a little nadir.,26600.363940000003,26602.442890000006
But right now your helmet's in contact with something.,26602.442890000006,26605.861440000004
Yep.,26609.898580000005,26610.398580000005
Good.,26611.297890000005,26611.537750000003
"And now if you wanna roll onto your side, and I don't know if you wanna go grab that.",26611.537750000003,26617.404820000003
Next handrail or not?,26617.884590000005,26619.763640000005
Because I think the panel you're trying to get to is further inboard.,26619.763640000005,26622.722160000005
It is.,26622.722160000005,26623.281880000006
I'm trying to you know how to turn.,26623.281880000006,26625.959430000006
I'm perfectly positioned on facing part though.,26627.298510000004,26630.297000000006
I wouldn't maybe face the truck for now.,26630.297000000006,26633.234820000005
Translate inboard.,26633.674590000006,26634.774300000005
And then and then rotate inside.,26634.874000000003,26637.013190000005
We get to do that.,26638.991950000003,26639.911490000006
"We like, we're still waiting here, you guys?",26639.911490000006,26642.490440000005
Impressively?,26643.299730000006,26643.799730000006
Affirm.,26644.379180000004,26644.879180000004
"We're still waiting, so keep doing Ricky.",26644.898930000003,26646.937900000004
What you're doing is great.,26646.937900000004,26648.137300000006
"If you see it in my picture, it's dead center.",26648.137300000006,26650.596330000004
On that side near the flat piece that's off to your to towards your back.,26651.144560000004,26655.222520000003
But it is a very small narrow point one single cable.,26655.222520000003,26658.340950000005
That's the ACC cable.,26658.340950000005,26659.680550000005
I see the patch.,26663.268440000003,26664.347900000004
I think we're the area with patch cut off should be.,26664.347900000004,26666.726960000004
Copy.,26667.906120000003,26668.406120000003
Right.,26670.024660000003,26670.524660000003
Yeah.,26671.903720000006,26672.183600000004
"We're standing by here just shortly, and we actually are now go.",26672.183600000004,26675.941720000006
So we are able to continue.,26675.941720000006,26678.600620000005
"And so, Kayla, over to you, you can GCA, Raja, into the worksite.",26679.109650000006,26684.647160000004
"And then when you both are comfortable, Raja, you can ingress the gap under AMS.",26684.706850000006,26688.674780000005
Okay.,26688.714760000006,26689.214760000006
"There we go to inboard, Roger.",26693.032600000006,26695.471380000006
Okay.,26695.471380000006,26695.971380000006
I'll try to stay as many as I can.,26696.849640000004,26698.748920000005
"If you're just joining us, we're five hours and forty three minutes in today's spacewalk.",26700.287920000006,26705.265660000005
Where Kayla Baron and Rasha Chari successfully installed the three a modification kit and completed tie bag multi layer insulation on spare battery charge discharge units to support robotic replacement or relocations.,26705.684700000005,26721.575620000003
They had time left and proceeded with a kidd ahead task.,26723.464390000005,26727.242770000004
They have also completed breaking torque and resetting bolts on spare battery charge.,26727.782220000005,26733.998050000006
Excuse me.,26735.457060000004,26736.136720000006
They have also completed breaking torque and resetting bolts on multiple orbital replacement units stored on the three A integrated electronics assembly on the s four truss.,26736.136720000006,26747.229220000005
They have just arrived to the Alpha magnetic spectrometer work site where they will do patch panel access evaluation.,26748.408390000004,26756.124060000006
Your white clip is barely kissing the MOI right now.,26756.543620000004,26763.398720000005
That's what I come down at all with a help.,26763.398720000005,26766.557120000005

"For the crate, so that should be okay to touch.",26793.881520000006,26796.260620000005
Barely touched.,26796.929690000004,26797.569370000005
I'll look at you guys.,26797.569370000005,26800.248050000006
Do you mind WBS and HEICO?,26800.248050000006,26801.827490000003
One of the other.,26804.864260000006,26805.844020000004

Do I have room to see more ports?,26817.237580000005,26818.976960000004
Or isn't it in Inboard?,26821.753880000004,26823.573220000006
Inboard?,26824.352570000003,26824.852570000003
"I can't see that, RASM, unfortunately.",26825.751900000003,26827.731140000004
I can see what's in front of me.,26828.279790000004,26829.599120000006
More more of the clearance behind my head in place.,26829.599120000006,26831.997920000005
"I think if you came further nadir, like, body down first.",26831.997920000005,26837.514020000006
"Because, yeah, now he's got much better clearance.",26838.053470000006,26841.072220000005
You can add further inboard.,26841.691650000004,26843.031250000004
K.,26843.979740000006,26844.139650000005
So I think I've got my hand my right hand on that lower US handrail they talked about in the drive room.,26844.139650000005,26850.934820000006
Affirm.,26851.094720000005,26851.534520000005
That's a good handrail.,26851.534520000005,26852.454040000004
"It was a blind reach, but that is a good handrail for you.",26852.454040000004,26855.112980000005
K.,26856.731920000006,26857.231920000006
And so then if I remember right then right under the end of this MLI should be the patch panel.,26857.291620000004,26861.958590000006
Correct?,26861.958590000006,26862.458590000006
That's gonna fall off.,26863.038060000006,26864.337650000005
Affirm.,26865.556800000006,26866.056800000006

I biggest issues I can't.,26875.351750000005,26878.809120000005
I have no kind of left in here.,26878.809120000005,26881.567750000006
And Hit down.,26881.567750000006,26885.524540000006
"Hey, Roger.",26888.502820000005,26888.982550000004
Do you think you have the the group of cables in insight?,26888.982550000004,26892.401100000003
Wash your right foot fender.,26895.639070000005,26897.058600000004

Copy.,26897.358190000006,26897.858190000006
Be careful with that rotation.,26897.957890000005,26899.257520000003
I can't rotate my head or body enough to speed.,26900.356690000004,26903.495360000004
"Them straight off, but I can see the cables running above the patch panel MOI.",26903.684820000006,26909.641850000004
"Like, if I look up towards where my second light Is that is the light?",26909.641850000004,26913.129280000005
I can see it on the corner of my helmet.,26913.129280000005,26915.108520000005
Okay.,26916.807420000005,26917.087280000003
So it will be a pretty challenging reach from here.,26917.087280000003,26919.426420000003
"And it's also pretty tough to see, but you can see them.",26919.664720000004,26922.643520000005
"And like Kayla says, let's watch the rotations.",26923.342920000003,26925.562080000003
But I'm gonna I'm gonna ask you some questions.,26925.581820000003,26927.420820000003
I don't need you to move around much just give me an assessment from where you are and Kayla you own clearances and keep us safe.,26927.420820000003,26934.447220000005
"So the first question, if you're ready, Roger.",26934.626920000006,26936.646120000005
So your right foot is just barely touching the MOI.,26937.044620000004,26940.263220000004
So don't do not rotate any further forward.,26940.362980000005,26943.781520000004
Copy.,26945.679750000003,26945.999580000003

Okay.,26946.999090000005,26947.278920000004
I'll just stay here until I answer the question.,26947.278920000004,26948.958120000003
Okay.,26948.958120000003,26949.458120000003

"First question, Roger, can you reach the entire perimeter of the data patch panel?",26953.134720000005,26957.332620000005
I can Back out more.,26957.332620000005,26963.419070000004
Yes.,26963.419070000004,26963.919070000004

It moves a little bit.,26977.101260000003,26978.119880000006
And then you can rotate it back a little bit.,26978.159850000004,26979.998970000004
There you go.,26979.998970000004,26981.917970000006

Do you think that BRT to that handrail would allow you to access the panel with both ends?,27182.162630000006,27186.740590000005
It's the I don't know if I could make the bend with the facing fork.,27191.308060000003,27194.626390000005

Right paper handle down.,27946.814670000003,27947.934120000005

I'm right.,27953.091560000004,27954.710970000004
And were those both for EV two?,27964.894320000003,27966.503620000003
Five.,27966.503620000003,27967.003620000003
EV one EV two.,28005.212470000006,28005.972080000003
I'm back with you.,28005.972080000003,28006.691720000006
"My fault for dragging you through that handover, but to confirm, SAFR handles for e b two.",28006.691720000006,28011.459570000006
"E b two, both safe harbor for that.",28015.197450000003,28016.916570000005
Pound.,28016.916570000005,28017.416570000005

Save for handles for EV two.,28022.343840000005,28023.863070000003
"And then, I guess, EV one's grabbing the strap bag onto the BRT.",28023.863070000003,28027.321600000003
EV two's grabbing the crew lock bag onto the BRT.,28027.541220000003,28029.920290000005
And I'll let you know where to go from there.,28030.909340000006,28032.928590000003
"Come back to your direction, Kayla?",28050.398920000003,28051.898420000005
I can't see you right now.,28052.437900000004,28053.637300000006
Give me one second.,28053.637300000006,28054.737000000005
Used in the other way it works on this bag.,28057.174520000004,28059.353670000004
I'm almost done.,28060.372920000005,28061.132540000006
Still be on the doorsteps with all six of them.,28061.132540000006,28063.551580000003
"We're pretty close to each other, but you could probably come off the foot if you need to.",28070.287050000006,28074.225320000005
I can wait.,28081.871220000005,28082.550880000006
Let me get that.,28082.550880000006,28083.650580000005
Can you hit the crew lock bag?,28093.894220000006,28095.473670000003
The strap bag on my VRT.,28117.889420000003,28119.588820000004
Okay.,28123.446620000006,28123.886360000004
Copy that.,28123.886360000004,28124.786220000005
Once EV two has the crew lock bag.,28125.045780000004,28128.564270000006
"You're going to translate inboard and the last person across EV one, depress the brakes after you're inboard of the starboard and port cedar cart.",28129.183720000005,28140.657820000004
"And you're translating to mile marker You're translating to mile marker sixty six hundred, and we're gonna do a test cable inspection when we get there.",28143.196350000006,28152.581360000004
That's good.,28167.841620000003,28168.141420000004
That's good.,28168.141420000004,28168.521320000003

I can see yours.,28195.843390000005,28196.783220000005
I can see blinds.,28197.082770000005,28198.102520000004
Roger?,28212.23266,28212.73266
Sorry.,28212.952300000004,28213.452300000004
Looking for sixty six hundred.,28218.148720000005,28219.768160000003
Start with Peter Kurt.,28246.22286,28247.602423000004
Alright.,28248.101923000002,28248.5417
Copy.,28248.5417,28248.86154
And make sure to hit those brakes please on that starboard to your cart once you're in board.,28248.86154,28253.288584
"And on the way, I'll give you the caution again.",28253.788084000003,28256.586683
Avoid touching the TUS cable We believe we've seen a little bit of a bend in the cable.,28256.586683,28262.542963000004
So we're having you go over there to do an inspection on the way in.,28262.542963000004,28267.12092
I see the test cable on the other side of the MC here.,28269.39942,28272.178286000002
I just walked you in the valley.,28273.277480000004,28274.936910000004
Right click that?,28275.984804000003,28276.964560000004
We're a minute and a half to a handover.,28277.743920000004,28280.522780000003
"And when you get to sixty six hundred, nader of bay nine, you're going to do a heck of survey of the test cable and test cable guide.",28281.062266000004,28290.496485000003
Which is right there in nature of Milemark's sixty six hundred.,28291.004800000002,28294.583260000003
"And We're currently in a brief handover period, but you're getting a live shot of international space station flight control room, where you hear, and as astronaut, Victor Glover, talk to the crew as they head towards the crew airlock to entertain spacewalk.",28294.722940000003,28312.873140000003
"Before they do so, they will be taking some HEKA or HD images.",28313.69248,28317.270940000002
You didn't have a rate pedal difference?,28318.229620000002,28320.08894
Okay.,28329.232880000003,28329.552720000003
"And be sure to press those brakes twice on the inboard seat of cart, please.",28329.552720000003,28334.410540000004
I did.,28337.738620000004,28338.39855
"Oh, inboard.",28339.457770000005,28340.197630000002
I'll get that report.,28340.257360000003,28341.416780000003
I wanna get there.,28341.416780000003,28342.096440000005
Alright.,28342.096440000005,28342.296340000004
That was sixty six hundred.,28342.296340000004,28343.755860000005
"See the process table going through, like, a guide thing there.",28346.334250000004,28349.552890000003
Affirmative.,28350.891970000004,28351.391970000004
That's the area question.,28351.411710000004,28352.531150000003
We currently We currently don't have Ku and we're ten seconds to hand over.,28352.531150000003,28356.79818
I'll get you on the other side.,28356.79818,28358.257690000002
You want me to hold here?,28361.494880000002,28362.754500000003
Hold.,28364.813220000004,28365.313220000004
No.,28365.49288,28365.692780000005
I don't you keep going at all.,28365.692780000005,28367.092080000002
Yes.,28367.092080000002,28367.29198
That's right.,28367.29198,28368.031860000003
Each other?,28384.08173,28384.821610000003
"Oh, shit.",28386.000780000002,28386.940550000003
I'm locked.,28387.629590000004,28388.029390000003
See if you're dragging up.,28388.029390000003,28390.088610000003
That might be the pause and Stand by.,28390.548130000003,28392.30725
Just let me get to the cedar wheel and we'll stop.,28392.30725,28395.246030000002
I've got the port cedar cover.,28406.759490000004,28409.758
It breaks pedal depressed twice.,28409.758,28411.697270000004
I'm turning around.,28412.436650000003,28413.596070000003
I agree your because it looks like it is unlocked.,28413.596070000003,28418.00398
"Are you real locked, I mean?",28418.223620000004,28419.843070000003
Almost.,28423.949280000004,28424.449280000004
Alright.,28425.788360000002,28426.288360000002
"Maybe it's not pulled too far, and you need to pull it a little farther to get it out.",28427.187650000003,28431.025740000005
Start starting to retract.,28431.105700000004,28432.6052
K.,28432.674880000002,28433.034700000004
And what's the gun?,28433.034700000004,28434.09442
And I want to go all the way now.,28436.233110000005,28437.672380000004
You're right?,28437.672380000004,28438.33231
Or the second.,28439.071690000004,28439.791320000004
Do you accept?,28439.791320000004,28440.491230000003
Backwards.,28446.937750000005,28447.437750000005
"If you're just joining us, this is live coverage of the two hundred and forty seventh spacewalk.",28450.6644,28455.242360000004
"And we're just waiting for KU to lock up And then once you've located the the area of concern, mile marker sixty six hundred and go nadir, and you'll see the test cable going through guides, the one that's almost directly nadir of biomarker.",28455.861800000002,28470.86228
"That's astronaut, Kayla Barron, and Rasha Chari, I've just completed the EMS or alpha magnet magnetic spectrometer patch panel assessment, and it's moving inboard.",28471.20185,28482.825960000002
The plan is to perform a HEKA or HD camera inspection of the THTUS cable and cable guide on the way back to the airlock.,28483.534730000003,28492.230620000002
And the test cable looks great.,28492.839880000003,28495.458830000003
Okay.,28495.95832,28496.45832
My perspective.,28497.237680000002,28497.93758
I can see it looking back towards Kayla.,28509.539030000004,28511.67822
I didn't see any bends or anything that with they might have a level of reflection.,28511.817900000002,28516.435820000002
It still looks pretty straight to me.,28516.904820000003,28518.84412
Okay.,28518.9838,28519.423560000003
Copy that.,28519.423560000003,28519.943300000003
Looking back towards her.,28520.02326,28521.282900000002
"And if you find that cable guide, again, that's just nadir of sixty six hundred.",28521.462560000004,28526.180180000003
Maybe it's slightly outboard of that area?,28526.180180000003,28528.589200000002
"I'd have to go pretty far outboard to get to the next four feet on the other side of the if you're the other side of the empty, the other side of four feet of car.",28532.646940000002,28540.8421
"They're about, like, six or seven feet apart.",28540.8421,28542.96106
I can looking at one right below sixty six hundred.,28542.96106,28545.858920000002
Okay.,28557.442420000003,28557.942420000003
Sixty six hundred at Kayla.,28560.819250000004,28562.178560000004
I think you're near sixty six hundred.,28562.178560000004,28563.737780000003
Is that correct?,28563.737780000003,28564.517640000002
Or am I at sixty six hundred?,28566.1366,28568.155820000004
"There is a test cable guide immediately nadir at sixty six hundred, and the test cable looks straight and no pink.",28568.854830000004,28576.191410000003
Okay.,28580.078620000004,28580.43845
Copy.,28580.43845,28580.93845
And I'm pretty sure I can see in my helmet light.,28582.95718,28584.916200000003
The next one is under the the port edge of the port to the car is one of the most guys.,28584.916200000003,28591.392820000005
Is that Okay.,28591.392820000005,28592.952030000004
Where are you running to that?,28592.952030000004,28594.65143
"Where can the area where Kayla is is what we're concerned about, the one right, under sixty six hundred.",28595.13978,28599.917640000003
"And so Kayla, are you able to see both inboard and outboard of that guide just on both sides of the guide and the cable looks straight on both sides.",28600.057310000004,28607.853080000004
Affirmative is straight.,28609.591980000005,28610.931550000005
And if you're able I know you still have that strap bag on your BRT.,28611.309880000004,28614.568510000005
"If you're able to go nadir of it and look Venus, go under and look up.",28614.58823,28619.464580000003
That's the perspective that we think we've seen.,28619.96408,28622.742920000004
The only problem without Ike is I'll risk touching the test cable to do that.,28625.779700000003,28630.517580000003
Have to get at a pretty wide thing stand down there and get the orientation you're asking for.,28633.194830000004,28640.091650000002
But I'm looking at it and it's not pink.,28640.929900000003,28643.268980000004
Yeah.,28643.5286,28643.84845
We can we can see it in your helmet as well.,28643.84845,28646.087310000003
"It's at the bottom of your helmet view, but we see it as well.",28646.087310000003,28648.885930000004
"And, yeah, it looks good.",28648.885930000004,28650.394930000002
"Again, the image that we have on the ground here is from nadir looking up.",28650.47488,28654.293210000003
"But if you think it looks straight, you're the eyes in the field, and it is slight bend.",28654.71278,28659.569700000004
"What we're seeing on the ground is a slight bend, and that cable is so wide.",28659.569700000004,28663.167910000004
It's like a ribbon.,28663.167910000004,28664.127410000005
Right?,28664.127410000005,28664.527220000004
It's on the nadir edge of that ribbon.,28664.527220000004,28666.886050000005
So Are you maybe able to get your mirror down there right under the guide just outboard?,28666.886050000005,28672.68268
Are you able to maybe see it in your mirror?,28673.022280000005,28675.161440000003
"I I can see it from here, actually.",28676.259620000004,28678.118930000004
"So maybe, like, two inches out forward of that guide.",28678.578460000004,28682.396780000003
"There's, like, a small in the cables, but I wouldn't call it.",28682.674930000005,28687.1127
I can't get it put together from where I'm at.,28687.1127,28690.630950000002
It just wasn't.,28690.630950000002,28691.450810000002
The line's not perfectly straight there.,28691.769900000003,28693.829130000002
Yeah.,28694.648480000003,28694.88834
"I see what you mean, Rajar.",28694.88834,28696.267920000002
Maybe what it is like is no.,28700.844180000004,28702.703520000003
No.,28706.401400000002,28706.901400000002
So can you see it?,28707.779780000004,28709.17908
M y w v s right here where I'm pointing?,28709.17908,28711.67808
Affirm.,28712.617380000003,28713.057130000005
"Yes, Kayla.",28713.057130000005,28713.61688
We do see that.,28713.61688,28714.296510000004

How are you today?,31600.428030000006,31601.407780000005
I'm doing great.,31603.186660000007,31604.306110000005
We are now at the end of this EVA.,31604.306110000005,31606.125450000007
And we still have the spacewalkers repressing.,31606.504960000006,31609.123920000005
"But as they come through, we'll see their suits.",31609.703360000007,31612.402280000006
I want you to tell the folks watching today what the difference we'll see with this suit and future artomist suits.,31613.101680000007,31619.698320000007
"Well, we're really excited to be building the next generation suit, both for the ISS program and for ARTEMIS.",31620.957450000005,31627.713030000006
"You'll see a lot of similarities, but obviously a lot of upgrades as well.",31628.372420000007,31633.689680000007
Right?,31634.109240000005,31634.389080000004
"The current EMU is is quite old, originally built to support the shuttle program and has been, you know, upgraded for both shuttle and space station over the decades.",31634.389080000004,31645.593710000005
"But the art of a suit is gonna bring some really neat new advantages to us, particularly in the mobility.",31646.812850000006,31653.049150000006
"The mobility of the new suit is gonna be greatly increased, and we will not only be using that additional mobility for ISS, but particularly when we get to the lunar surface where we have a gravity field and we really need that extra mobility so that our astronauts get don't get too tired.",31653.588640000005,31671.539840000005
You're gonna see also the suits be able to fit a much wider range of astronaut sizes.,31673.118820000007,31679.136080000004
"So we'll be able to support very, very small crew members all the way up to very large crew members.",31679.514880000006,31685.891960000004
"So a wide range of anti parametric size Of course, just technology has come a long way since the EMU was first designed.",31685.951680000006,31695.786610000006
"So we're gonna see a lot of neat new capabilities like in heads up displays and the helmet, a lot of dual redundancy and safety systems within the life support system itself.",31695.786610000006,31708.958120000007
"Of course, when we're on the lunar surface, we have to worry about dust.",31709.857410000004,31713.065020000005
So we will be making sure we take care of the dust and the special overgarments that we have with the new suit for Artemis.,31713.144980000005,31721.680980000005
And those are some are just the big highlights.,31722.009880000005,31724.029130000006
That's awesome to hear.,31727.407180000006,31728.726580000006
And I now see that we are open in the hatch.,31728.726580000006,31730.995010000006
To get the crew members inside the equipment side of the airlock as they do venture over and we do see the EMU that we currently have.,31731.154930000004,31739.251120000004
I know you talked a little bit about the future of spacewalks.,31739.339980000004,31741.958940000004
Will the future space where will this future spacewalks take place?,31742.538380000005,31746.336480000005
And what are the goals for the suits.,31746.336480000005,31750.194230000005
"As I mentioned, the new suits are gonna be used on both space station and on the moon lunar surface.",31754.132040000004,31760.518150000004
And then some of those technologies could even play forward to Mars eventually.,31760.577840000005,31764.436180000004
But we are are looking to support the ARTEMIS program with basically annual flights to the lunar surface.,31765.404740000005,31772.221580000005
Our requirements right now are are basically looking at about twenty four hours of EVA per week while the crew is there on their annual visit to the Lunar South Pole.,31772.769780000006,31784.723280000006
That is amazing to hear.,31786.941910000005,31789.099380000007
And I know you are the new program manager for the new program EVA and HSM or the human surface mobility program.,31789.099380000007,31799.213950000005
What are the importance of this for the autonomous autonomous missions?,31800.479840020005,31804.298180500005
Yeah.,31805.517320000006,31805.757200000004
"So our new program were very, very new.",31805.757200000004,31807.836160600003
We just were formed and established here in January.,31807.836160600003,31811.083940000004
"So the team is just setting up, but our we have a couple of goals One of our goals is to make sure that we have consistency in our EVA capability across ISS and the ARTEMIS campaigns.",31811.303580000007,31824.805601000004
"But then for the Artemis missions on the lunar surface, we're looking at a really integrated set of mobility capabilities.",31825.774858000004,31832.871560000007
"So the astronauts' ability to move away from the lander while they're suited either in a non pressurized river that we call the lunar terrain vehicle or the LTV, or a pressurized rover.",31833.211140000007,31845.934280000005
"So bringing those elements all together under one program gives us a lot of advantages We get to develop those systems synergistically, making sure the requirements are are met and allocated across the systems so that when we do get to the south pole, we have a really well integrated, highly functioning system, set of lunar surface systems for the cruise to be able to explore the lunar surface.",31846.593700000005,31874.517460000006
And that has been great goals.,31876.494816000006,31878.173980000007
And I know we're heading towards ARTEMIS missions here soon.,31878.173980000007,31881.472576000004
So is there anything else we need to know about the future of space suits?,31881.772175000006,31885.960080000004
I just think it's a really exciting time.,31887.279420000006,31889.778416000005
We are in the process right now of evaluating proposals for our new suits.,31889.998060000005,31895.535540000004
So we're looking forward to awarding that contract here in the next couple of months.,31895.775000000005,31901.612080000006
"And getting our new vendor or vendors on board with us, so we can start working with them.",31901.612080000006,31908.297540000007
We are hoping to have our new suit transitioned on the space station towards the end of twenty twenty five.,31908.837025000004,31915.452920000007
"And then, of course, we're looking at the new suit on the lunar surface for Artemis.",31915.592600000004,31920.250520000005
Three also in the twenty twenty five time frame.,31920.819980000004,31923.218784000004
So it's gonna be a a couple of really busy years for the EVA community.,31923.218784000004,31927.956660000003
"And that is all we have time for today, but thank you Laura for joining us.",31929.844810000006,31934.442510000004
"Again, Laura Kearney is the program manager for the newly created extra vehicle activity in human surface mobility program.",31934.442510000004,31940.939180000005

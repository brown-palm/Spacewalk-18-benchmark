"But as with as with many items that are exposed to the harsh environments of space, the alpha magnetic spectrometer needed to be upgraded to continue data collection.",35.04,43.54
"You were looking live inside the station's Quest Airlock where two astronauts, NASA engineer, Drew Morgan, on your right, and Expedition sixty one commander, Luca Parmatano of the European Space Agency on your left are suited up, ready to begin the fourth and final planned spacewalk to repair the alpha magnetic spectrometer.",47.145,64.345
AMS began showing signs of age in two thousand fourteen when one of the cooling pumps stopped working on an and another one was found to have degraded.,71.28001,79.545006
"In March of twenty seventeen, researchers switched to the last fully functional pump to keep the science alive.",80.085,85.705
The AMS team realized they would need to take action to keep the scientific instrument going and enable the AMS to function through the lifetime of the International Space Station leading to the series of four spacewalks.,86.17,98.075
These spacewalks are considered to be the most complex of their kind since the Hubble Space Telescope.,98.775,103.675
The AMS was originally designed for a three year mission and unlike Hubble was not designed to be serviced once in space.,105.22,112.200005
"The work to prepare for the spacewalk, which began about four years ago, involved making, testing, and launching more than twenty new tools to the Space Station.",121.48,129.74
"Many specialized for specific specific steps of the spacewalk, such as removing the debris shield, which was done in the first spacewalk and tools to splice cooling lines, which was performed in the second space walk.",130.205,142.04

I read it.,10959.90001,10960.465
Okay.,10961.025,10961.525
And I read it off.,10962.065,10964.325
Yeah.,10964.94499,10965.265
I have it.,10965.265,10966.165
French is still with Luca.,10970.86,10971.90001
Okay.,10971.90001,10972.14
Thanks.,10972.14,10972.64
And I copy as well.,10981.495,10982.775
"And with that, we are ready to take you body out.",10982.775,10985.62999
It's gonna be about forty five centimeters.,10985.62999,10987.56999
"And, Luca, that'll be body out for Drew.",10993.555,10995.875
"So who will be, clearances to AMS should be increasing, but we'll take your eyes on any clearances in the area.",10995.875,11001.66
"If I can ask you to go body down first, clean that ten centimeters, is it the best?",11001.82,11008.08
NASA astronaut Christina Cook at the controls of the robotic arm today.,11010.675,11014.835
She's going to go ahead and back Drew Morgan off from his position where he is right now working on the AMS.,11014.835,11021.72
"Thank you, motion.",11027.88501,11028.705
And starting motion.,11033.88501,11035.105
It goes you through her domain.,11036.21,11037.83
Okay.,11040.45,11040.85
We're starting motion now.,11040.85,11042.23
Stop you.,11042.29001,11043.095
There you go.,11055.74,11056.64
Good morning.,11057.02002,11057.84
That was your ten body down.,11058.275,11059.79498
"And if you agree, we'll go ahead and do a what will be about forty centimeters body out at this time.",11059.79498,11065.255
For adjusting.,11065.97,11066.71
"It is now much better, and you'll go for body out.",11066.77,11070.55
Okay.,11070.77,11071.09
Thank you for that adjustment.,11071.09,11072.39
"And starting motion, forty centimeters body out.",11072.69,11075.35
Much is the payment?,11088.12,11089.18
Good.,11091.47998,11091.97998
And stand by for the next.,11099.545,11101.085
Okay.,11115.265,11115.585
Your next motion is up about fifteen degrees.,11115.585,11118.725
Okay.,11121.55,11122.05
Question.,11122.43,11122.93
"Okay, Drew.",11171.49002,11172.37003
That was your pitch.,11172.37003,11173.33002
"Next, we're going to just take out a little bit more body down.",11173.33002,11176.61002
It'll be about thirteen centimeters.,11176.61002,11178.31
Copy.,11178.715,11179.215
Motion.,11179.675,11179.995
Good motion.,11179.995,11187.455
Okay.,11190.84,11191.15997
And that was the rest of your body down.,11191.15997,11192.75998
"Finally, we'll go right about fifteen centimeters.",11192.75998,11195.41998
Copy.,11195.955,11196.455
Starting mission.,11197.07498,11197.975
Okay.,11206.66,11207.16
And that was your fifteen.,11207.94,11209.4
Standby while we set up for the next.,11209.62,11211.48
Okay.,11212.41998,11212.91998
We just got a w good WPS on me.,11319.28503,11321.945
"Hey, affirm, Drew.",11327.35,11328.63
We do.,11328.63,11329.37
K.,11330.87,11331.37
"Looking back at the MOI, there's the two notches cut down cut in the bottom, the side closer to the c hook, the way that it fits over there.",11333.19,11344.79
It kinda gaps over here to the the right if you can see that.,11344.79,11349.85
And I can adjust the as we got pictures of it.,11349.91,11353.66504
But just the way that flap is cut and the way to cut out of the bottom of the but made it works right here.,11353.66504,11360.13995
It kind of opened it.,11361.48,11362.92
"It's over to the right side, so it's not near the a f works right.",11362.92,11366.62
K.,11367.625,11367.785
"We're handing over here, Drew.",11367.785,11369.305
I'll be back in twenty seconds.,11369.305,11370.845
"Hey, Drew.",11407.7349997,11408.215
"And, Luca, this is Nana.",11408.215,11409.8949995
We are ready to proceed with your next manual maneuver.,11409.8949995,11413.195
It's gonna be approximately one meter aft Drew is gonna be in the direction of your feet.,11413.334999,11417.96
Copy.,11418.02,11418.52
Starting motion.,11419.939999,11420.76
"Okay, Drew.",11433.98,11434.96
"We, we couldn't really see what you're talking about.",11437.019997,11439.579998
"It's just too dark in that view, but they on your words and description, we're okay with that because we have the original blanket underneath that area.",11439.579998,11447.465
And so we don't we don't have a concern based on what you said.,11447.845,11450.405
Does that make sense?,11450.405,11451.27
To you?,11451.27,11452.010002
It does.,11452.95,11453.69
Yes.,11453.83,11454.23
The I can see original inner layers definitely there intact and covering everything.,11454.23,11458.95
"So, yeah, I just wanted to make sure.",11458.95,11460.97
Okay.,11462.065,11462.545
Yep.,11462.545,11463.024998
Good call.,11463.024998,11463.765
We're happy with that.,11464.305,11465.604996
"Drew, that completes that motion.",11468.63,11469.909996
"Your next motion is gonna be about a quarter meter zenith, which is body in for you.",11469.909996,11474.31
Copy.,11474.31,11474.81
Starting motion.,11475.75,11476.57
Hello?,11478.885,11479.385
"Just to recap some milestones so far, Drew Morgan completed the leak inspections at the Nader Works site and found no leaks, Luca Parmatano tightened the connection on the leaking tube that he found, starting the one hour dwell clock, after which it will be re inspected, Luca Parmatano also completed the remaining VSB or vertical support beam tube inspections and found no additional leaks.",11486.14,11507.47
"The crew is currently waiting for the clock to run out in just under twenty minutes from now when they can reevaluate the tube that Parmatino tightened, If the tube shows a slight sliver of red, Parmatino will tighten the tube again, and if it's more than a sliver, the crews will reevaluate how to proceed.",11507.715004,11524.189995
"The complexity of these AMS repairs and the initial expectations for its full restoration, which is anticipated after today's spacewalk, Harkens the thought of icarus, the son of the Master Craftsman Daedalus.",11525.015,11536.76
"Drew, your next question is In the mythological interpretation, icarus father asks that he fly neither too high nor too low.",11536.9,11545.585
The AMS repair work being conducted by Morgan and Parmatano is often compared to the servicing of the Hubble Space Telescope.,11545.585,11553.06
"Okay, gentlemen.",11556.4,11557.37999
"We're tracking that you're on your way common, Drew.",11557.51999,11559.345
Here's a big picture update for you.,11559.345,11561.585
We're an hour forty into the EVA.,11561.585,11563.505
We're essentially on the the original timeline of the EVA.,11563.505,11567.045
Our limiting consumable is Medox on you drew at six forty two.,11567.58,11571.59999
"So the big picture plan right now is we're just gonna leave you at at common, Drew, once you get there.",11572.94,11578.745
We'll wait another eighteen minutes until the clock expires on two five.,11578.745,11584.89
We'll have Luca check it.,11584.89,11586.51001
"And, there's three options there.",11586.97,11588.73001
"One, it's good to go.",11588.73001,11589.95
"Then we'll just proceed with you going to zenith, two.",11590.105,11594.125
"If we have a sliver of a leak, then we'll probably go ahead and do one more flat and another hour clock.",11594.185,11601.06
"If we have a big leak, like we had initially, this would be the third option then we're gonna talk about that, but that might send us direct to a jumper.",11601.52,11610.165
"And that's why we'll hold you at common, Drew, because we might wanna bring the arm into the VSP in that case.",11610.305,11616.245
Alright.,11619.01,11619.40999
Copy all.,11619.40999,11619.89
Sounds like a great plan.,11619.89,11621.26999
"I'm green, Luke.",11621.96999,11622.95
I need two copies and it sounds like the plan.,11623.17,11625.67
Okay.,11626.795,11627.295
Alright.,11627.355,11627.755
"Well, we got seventeen minutes left on that clock for number five.",11627.755,11630.895
"Andrew, that is position hold at AMS common, and we copy that we'll be waiting here with you for a little while.",11739.22,11744.585
Are you gonna day pass?,11752.12,11753.58
Now one hour and forty three minutes into the space walk today.,11796.82498,11800.345
"This is the final In a series of four spacewalks to repair the alpha magnetic spectrometer, the AMS was launched on Space Shuttle Endeavor to the station eight and a half years ago to study dark, invisible matter that can't be directly detected.",11800.345,11814.025
The goal of the alpha magnetic spectrometer has been for scientists to track down sources to help understand dark matter and the origins of the universe.,11814.485,11822.06
"As with many items that are exposed to the harsh environment of space, the alpha magnetic spectrometer needed to be upgraded to continue collecting data.",11822.44,11830.525
"AMS began showing signs of age in two thousand fourteen when one of the cooling pumps stopped working, and another was found to have been degraded.",11831.065,11838.77
"In March of twenty seventeen, researchers switched to the last fully functional pump to keep the science alive.",11839.31,11845.41
The AMS team realized they would need to take action to keep the scientific instrument going and enable the AMS to function through the lifetime of the International Space Station.,11845.735,11854.98
Leading to the series of four spacewalks.,11855.06,11857.16
These spacewalks are considered to be the most complex of their kind since the Hubble Space Telescope Telescope Servicing missions.,11857.7,11863.96002
"The AMS originally was designed for a three year mission, and unlike Hubble was not designed to be serviced once in space.",11864.455,11871.195
"The work to prepare for the space walks, which began about four ago involved making, testing, and launching more than twenty new tools to the space station, many specialized for specific steps of a spacewalk, such as removing the debris shield, which was done in the first spacewalk, and tools to splice cooling lines, which was performed in the second spacewalk.",11910.13,11929.06995
"These tools have gone through years of iterations and tests here on Earth by scientists, engineers, and astronauts.",11929.53503,11934.91504
"The two space walkers today And for the series of the repairs, Drew Morgan and Luca Parmatano had seven training sessions in the neutral buoyancy laboratory dedicated to repair training for these alpha magnetic spectrometer spacewalks.",11935.53503,11947.705
Gloves are intact for steaming.,11955.83,11957.99
"Look like baseline, the half is dry.",11957.99,11959.85
Two gloves are baseline.,11964.815,11968.195
"I give you one then, copy.",11971.23004,11974.35004
Right.,11974.35004,11974.85004
Okay.,11975.39,11975.89
Copy.,11976.11005,11976.51
Thanks for those.,11976.51,11977.49
"So I don't know if you guys are just bored out there and fill in time, but you could tell me a non spacewalker what it looks like, in a night pass looking down at the planet.",11980.88495,11990.06
What do you see?,11990.06,11990.96
Yeah.,11991.82,11992.32
"I was gonna ask you, where we were because I don't think I've ever looked back in there or or during an EDA.",11992.46,11999.59503
"On a night pass, I just turned my lights out.",12000.08,12001.92
"I'm out here in the inky black above the, ISS looking down.",12001.92,12005.3599997
"I can see entire truck, but just past the charge.",12005.3599997,12009.325
We just flew over a lot of great night lights.,12009.545,12012.925
Yeah.,12016.265,12016.585
"It looks like you're about to see of Japan just off the East East side of, Asia there.",12016.585,12024.33
K.,12026.15,12026.47
Yeah.,12026.47,12026.79
So Yeah.,12026.79,12028.564999
It looks very heavily populated.,12028.564999,12030.185
So we'll be over Japan then shortly.,12030.404999,12032.585
I I can already see it.,12033.364998,12035.204998
Do you know me?,12035.204998,12036.165
Uh-huh.,12036.165,12036.565
There it is.,12036.565,12037.45
Yep.,12037.77,12038.010002
I saw them with the sea of Japan.,12038.010002,12039.37
We just passed it.,12039.37,12040.09
"You can see some fishing fleets out there in the sea of Japan, and then you can see the entire Island.",12040.09,12046.115
It's Japan.,12046.115,12046.755
"Hello, Tsukuba.",12046.755,12047.575
"I'm hearing on the back loops at, Chris is in Tokyo today.",12056.550003,12060.15
So you can wave at him on your way by.,12060.15,12062.25
"That's right, Chris.",12063.774998,12066.494995
"And we both of you guys have been great mentors and, yeah, got a note from Chris wishing us luck.",12066.494995,12071.45
And I agree on both counts on the membership.,12075.189995,12077.689995
It's been everyone's pleasure for sure.,12079.895004,12081.835
"So, Luca, I gotta know, what made you pick number five first?",12082.055,12085.435005
It wants the closest.,12088.8,12089.94
"It's the c four c think was out, so it was right in front of me.",12090.48,12096.274994
"I'm like, don't forget to point to start.",12096.274994,12099.575
I was wondering if you had some sort of intuition or something.,12101.4,12104.14
Yeah.,12106.12,12106.520004
"Like I say, it's almost better to be locked even good.",12106.520004,12109.525
"Well, it was both.",12112.085,12113.385
"Suppose it saved us some time on the clock, getting that one, getting the timer started, and that one first there's no other way to do that to create more drama than, giving us a that look on the first one.",12114.245,12125.420006
I think everybody's heart stopped.,12125.880005,12127.58
Yeah.,12130.385,12130.785
I wonder what my my flight surgeon saw on the on the phone mode on my heart rate.,12130.785,12137.73
Yeah.,12138.75,12139.06999
They're not allowed to tell us.,12139.06999,12140.18999
I don't think.,12140.18999,12141.01
It's either flatline or spike while on the tube.,12143.755,12146.895
Yeah.,12148.235,12148.635
No doubt.,12148.635,12149.375
Alright.,12150.235,12150.735
Eight more minutes to go.,12150.795,12152.255
"So, Drew, how quickly does the view change?",12157.43,12159.59
"Do you still see population, or is it just out in the black of the Pacific now.",12159.59,12164.44499
"I can see, Japan pushed past my feet kinda disconnect still see the lights.",12166.025,12172.18
Definitely can make out probably Tokyo.,12172.87999,12175.76
I imagine for this stuff.,12175.76,12177.195
It's really bright.,12177.51501,12178.475
Looks like maybe it's cloud covered enough because of the way that the night lights reflect on the the clouds at night.,12178.475,12184.79501
"Kinda gives it a a more smudge, less the think, appearance.",12184.79501,12188.79999
"But, yeah, we're definitely out out of the Pacific now.",12188.85999,12191.59999
"So when you look out in the direction of Pacific, do you just see nothing out there?",12197.155,12200.855
Yeah.,12202.435,12202.935
"Right now there is a you know, in closer, like, to see if Japan is there.",12202.995,12207.9
"We do see fishing fleets very distinctly, but this far out, I don't I don't know that we usually see I'm pushing this far off the the coast.",12207.9,12216.835
No.,12216.895,12217.135
It it's not concentrated enough to make out the lights.,12217.135,12220.275
"And can you guys look out from the station and see the stars, or is there too much light on the on the station?",12224.76,12230.06
I'm looking out over my left shoulder.,12233.055,12234.73499
"I can make out a couple of stars, for sure.",12234.73499,12238.435
"I we do have the, the light looks like from one of the, looks like the lab light or something shining kinda had us.",12238.65001,12246.305
"So that, you know, that kind of washes it out a bit.",12246.385,12252.325
"But there definitely can see some All I see is, that's in case and a bunch of tubes.",12252.94499,12262.09
Drew definitely has a better view.,12265.82498,12267.76498
"So, like, when you see those stars there, Drew, are they bright or are they dark?",12268.625,12271.745
"Like, how's it compared to being in a dark place on the planet?",12271.745,12274.77
"You know, right now, just with the floodlight competing, they look very comparable to what we would see on Earth looking at through the atmosphere.",12277.55,12288.505
"But when there isn't light like that, we can when you can't see stars, they are distinctively bright and they don't I'll twinkle the way that the atmosphere causes, the twinkling effect.",12288.725,12299.92
So they're more constant.,12300.22,12302.145
Yeah.,12304.525,12304.925
Of course.,12304.925,12305.585
"And then and then, Luca, I previously had seen, well, we're I don't think we're ever determine what what plan that it was, but, I mean, they distinctly saw one on the on the horizon from out here.",12305.645,12319.07498
I called it out during GCA.,12323.375,12324.995
Alright.,12340.025,12340.505
Five minutes left on the clock.,12340.505,12342.125
Nine four five.,12344.86,12345.91998
"Alright, Luca.",12347.58,12348.3
Let me find the best by position ever for this.,12348.3,12351.655

We I'd say we don't burn any bridges we're in position.,16269.685,16273.21
Let's start the MLI tent according to the original plan where Luca was in our where there was a we came to the BSP site to start the MLI.,16273.59,16283.585
So I'd say we start the MLI with us in our current positions.,16283.725,16286.945
I'm right we're right here.,16287.085,16288.48
Okay.,16289.44,16289.94

"So first, the next step is actually for you, Luca, going back into the worksite.",16326.07001,16330.41
Let's just do one last check of those AAFs.,16330.55,16332.935
So we'll check-in the MLI.,16332.935,16334.235
No exposed tubes or contact between tubes.,16334.695,16337.91501
We'll grab a couple of closeout photos.,16338.455,16340.475

"The only thing that is lost nominal is that number seven and number three are not over the scratches, keeping the count.",16344.14,16355.85501

"Recapping some milestones, Drew Morgan, completed the leak inspections at the Nader Works site and found no leaks.",16422.76,16428.78
Luca Parmatano found one leak out of eight tombs on the first tube that he checked and was able to tighten the connection on the leaking tube.,16429.0,16436.375
"And after it was after it was re inspected, the tube failed again and had another leak on the third re inspection.",16437.395,16444.37999
The tube had no indication of a leak and The duo is now moving down the timeline as originally planned.,16444.92,16454.045
Luca Parmatano just opened up the accumulator which will pressurize the new system ensuring all the cooling lines are holding pressure as expected for the resumption of the activation of the system.,16454.825,16465.38998
They'll now take closeout photos at the worksite before they move on to the next task.,16473.58,16478.56
"If you want, you may do like the call?",16479.02,16480.86

"Therefore, the jumper installation was not required.",17169.445,17171.945
And Morgan and Parmatano were able to continue moving down the timeline as originally planned.,17172.26,17177.0
Alright.,17182.96503,17183.36502
Yeah.,17183.36502,17183.605

"And then on hook six, I have a tool board.",17259.03,17262.89
Never took anything off the tool board?,17263.425,17265.525
And I can drill tool by The view now from Drew Morgan's helmet camera as he does a Tool check with the crews here in Mission Control Houston.,17267.665,17277.13998
"Seventy eight combination wrench, rough cutter, tooth straightener, tooth puller, got an adjustable and a small, small red.",17277.36,17286.74503

That's it.,17296.59,17297.39
We got it all.,17297.39,17298.365
"Inside the lid of the red bag is a small, small ret, and that bag will be complete.",17298.845,17303.425

"Here, Drew.",17339.295,17339.77496
Here's a question for you.,17339.77496,17340.735
Those two contingency bags Did we ever open them?,17340.735,17343.61
I do.,17345.11,17345.85
Alright.,17346.87,17347.35

Okay.,17358.98,17359.48
Alright.,17359.77997,17360.18
We've got a good red bag inventory.,17360.18,17361.95996
"Again, this helmet camera from Drew Morgan who just completed an inventory check with the crews here in Mission Control Houston.",17385.225,17392.45
Morgan confirmed that neither of the contingency bags needed to be used,17396.38495,17400.0
During this spacewalk.,17400.0,17400.98
Alright.,17402.3999999,17402.8
And we'll need a glove and half check from you guys.,17402.8,17405.14
"Hey, Luca.",17411.595,17412.575001
Thirty too bad.,17413.035,17414.075001

"Is gapped on tape from from the tool board, but good.",17426.244999,17430.484999
Everything else looks good over you.,17430.484999,17432.345
That'll be true.,17433.969997,17434.87
"The gloves are still during the, baseline conditions, they were happy to drive.",17436.449997,17445.605

"Luca, where are we at in the hook, Well, I am working on we're outside now.",17448.065002,17461.555
I'm trying to figure out if I can do it from here.,17461.695,17466.195
It's actually probably easy if I get off the arm again.,17466.96,17469.86
Do I?,17471.68,17472.42
Okay.,17473.76,17474.26

And then only one of you moving at a time.,17492.405,17494.825
K.,17513.635,17513.875
"The three sides of the initial in the line that installed, and I mean, I'm tapping as hard as I can.",17513.875,17525.09
"Luka, what will help, I think, is if you start that one that goes over the the zenith, That's over the hole that goes over the zener.",17526.995,17536.97
"And then the one over here that goes over the nadir handrail, the that'll give you something to pull pull that taut and get that okra mated, I think.",17537.27,17548.125
I'm looking for the hole.,17549.04,17552.42
It's the vehicle.,17559.105,17560.325
Here.,17560.78499,17561.28499

Yeah.,17587.95499,17588.26
K.,17592.01999,17592.51999
I have to be out of the hole.,17593.29999,17596.43999
So you have the tether point going through there.,17599.095,17601.335
Okay.,17601.335,17601.835
Alright.,17619.035,17619.515
We see bravo Luca.,17619.515,17620.735
And the hole for Charlie goes over the nadir handrail.,17623.79,17626.68999
One where the hook comes out and one where the hole is.,17632.72499,17635.305
Alright.,17647.77,17648.09
K.,17648.09,17648.49
We see a good Charlie and delta is the clip over the nadir handrail.,17648.49,17653.18501
"Let's get that, that clever push.",17670.035,17672.375
Okay.,17680.56,17680.8
"The, there's another one right here.",17680.8,17683.54
Lucette delta.,17688.345,17689.065
Can you are you able to see that one?,17689.065,17690.685
Yes.,17700.00998,17700.25
You go go through the hole.,17700.25,17702.27
Yes.,17702.645,17703.125
We need to hit we need to get the clip on the okay.,17703.125,17706.745
And then you need to get pushed over that.,17720.115,17722.695
Alright.,17723.79498,17724.29498
I can get a little deeper in.,17725.315,17727.655
Can feel it.,17729.78998,17730.77
K.,17731.38998,17731.88998
"And then there's a through this one, we release the hook, and we put the hook through.",17732.43,17739.975
Do you have access to the hook?,17740.195,17741.815
"It's underneath the MLI, so I gotta That's okay.",17742.355,17745.6
I can get you.,17745.6,17746.66
And then she can hold it?,17758.23502,17760.075
I got it.,17760.075,17760.75
There you go.,17774.085,17774.985
And then rehook it on that loop.,17775.205,17777.06497
Right.,17781.94998,17782.35
From the meter MLI Yeah.,17782.35,17785.255
"Taking that hook and it's wrapped through the original loop, trapping, spot bolts, Okay.",17785.255,17793.05
"Like, that all tracks good.",17793.35,17794.95
We saw it happen.,17794.95,17795.93
So the next thing is the there's a stiffener on the golf side.,17796.47,17800.57
"I guess along the IPA, and we wanna check the gap by the IPA there and push that stiffener in.",17802.14502,17809.125
So the wrong shape unfortunately right now.,17811.74002,17814.24002
What?,17816.86002,17817.36002
It's different in the wrong shape.,17818.22,17820.0
"Beads the pants, a little bit bent.",17822.635,17826.255
It goes over the IPA in inside.,17833.02,17834.94
Correct?,17834.94,17835.44
It goes it gets tucked in behind.,17836.755,17838.77502
Yeah.,17839.15503,17839.475
In behind the IPA.,17839.475,17840.695
Remember the Sharp Edge is back there?,17841.635,17843.575
Could you have a few of that?,17855.525,17856.985
No.,17861.71,17861.94998
"Not really, Luca.",17861.94998,17862.75
"It's just too dark for us to make anything out, but you see any gaps?",17862.75,17866.84998
Or is it pretty much snug against the IPA?,17867.06998,17869.33
"Oh, that looks pretty good.",17870.045,17871.505
So it looks good to us.,17879.49,17880.53
"What good do you, Luca?",17880.53,17881.75
It's good.,17884.29,17884.85
Yeah.,17884.85,17885.35
Okay.,17885.855,17886.255
"And then just, give us a peek over on the vacuum case side and make sure there's no gaps over there.",17886.255,17891.555
That's the line from bravo to Charlie.,17891.935,17894.195
"Double Just the line that's up here, and we'll have a better look at that.",17896.90002,17909.095
When you come to the zenith side?,17910.16,17911.68
Yeah.,17911.68,17911.92
I think that it's easier if I if I do this from the zenith side.,17911.92,17918.9
Okay.,17919.025,17919.34503
I gave you truth.,17919.34503,17920.325
That's fine.,17920.465,17921.28503
"And, so then we're gonna go to the zenith side, and then we'll do the we'll cover up the handrails on the box, the faces of the box, confirm.",17922.22504,17928.885
K.,17929.8,17930.04
Is the travel driving line?,17930.04,17931.66
Yep.,17932.27997,17932.77997
But they wanna see it all the way up there where we can't quite see in a vacuum.,17932.83997,17936.7
Right.,17936.92,17937.24
I'm gonna hold on two.,17937.24,17938.7

"It's look good to you, Luca.",17953.04004,17954.34
"I mean, the vacuum case is red.",17957.095,17959.01495
"So, of course, we we're not calling Yeah.",17959.01495,17962.65497

"We have a good clip, Delta Okay.",17981.555,17984.10004
"And the golf, you pushed the, the end of the handrail into golf.",17984.10004,17989.64
"Because it's not the handrail, but it's like the slider.",17992.665,17995.08496
That's the pocket.,17998.505,17999.64496

"We got the, the hook.",18007.6,18009.62
Golf golf is on the handrail through the hole with the hook around it.,18010.865,18017.505
With the hook from the nadir blanket.,18017.505,18019.365

I don't think we can point that we can do that.,18175.42,18177.685
And the work is now complete to install the multi layer insulation.,18177.685,18181.465
"Luca's got, seven eighths with the mini.",18182.405,18184.325

"On the third inspection, no leaks were shown.",18670.174995,18672.494995
"Therefore, the jumper installation was not required, and Morgan and Parmatano were able to continue moving down the timeline as originally planned.",18672.494995,18679.65
They worked together most recently to install an MLI or layer insulation tent underneath the AMS pump system to close out the formal debris shield worksite.,18680.03001,18689.335
"And the crew will now stall a mud flap between the new pump and vertical support beam or VSB, then remove a shower cap to expose the new radiator system.",18690.035,18698.68

Now three hours and forty three minutes into the fourth and final planned spacewalk to repair the alpha magnetic spectrometer.,19006.165,19013.785
The AMS was launched on Space Shuttle Endeavor to the station eight and a half years ago to study dark matter and and invisible matter that can't be directly detected.,19014.65,19023.31
The goal of the alpha magnetic spectrometer has been for scientists to track down sources to help understand dark matter and the origins of the universe.,19023.675,19031.18
"And over the last eight and a half years, AMS has collected data on over one hundred and forty billion cosmic ray events.",19031.58,19037.84
"But as with many items that are exposed to the harsh environment of space, the alpha magnetic spectrometer needed to be upgraded to continue collecting data.",19038.13998,19046.465
"AMS began showing signs of age in two thousand fourteen when one of the cooling pumps stopped working, and another was found to have degraded.",19047.3,19054.03998
"In March of twenty seventeen, researchers switched to the last fully functional pump to keep the science alive.",19054.885,19060.345
The AMS team realized they would need to take action to keep the science instrument going and enable the AMS to function through the lifetime of the International Space Station leading to the series of four spacewalks.,19060.725,19071.35
The spacewalks are considered the most complex of their kind since the Hubble Space Telescope Serviceingmissions.,19073.905,19078.965
The AMS originally was designed for a three year mission and unlike Hubble was not designed to be serviced once in space.,19080.25,19086.83002
Two minutes in course at AMS common.,19087.935,19089.875
"The work to prepare for the space block, which began about four years ago, involved making, testing, and watching more than twenty new tools to the space station, many specialized for specific steps of the space walk, such as removing the debris shield, which was done in the first space walk and tools to splice cooling lines, which was performed in the second space walk.",19090.975,19110.475
"These tools have gone through years of iterations and tests, here on Earth by scientists, engineers, and astronauts, the two space walkers today, have both worked with these tools and had seven training sessions in the neutral buoyancy laboratory dedicated to repair training for these AMS spacewalks.",19110.535,19127.365

"Alright, Luca.",20231.38,20232.02

That'll be all.,20256.195,20257.17502

"I think I managed to, to scuffle down it looks it looks solid.",20284.27002,20293.47498
"Looks good to us, Luca.",20300.21,20301.41
We like it.,20301.41,20302.31
"And all cables covered, completely covered by the old MLI, completely covered.",20304.77002,20314.595
"And then, make sure that the mud flap goes over there.",20314.595,20318.31
Yep.,20318.31,20318.81
Okay.,20318.95,20319.45

Yeah.,20348.045,20348.545
No.,20349.565,20350.065
That that would work well.,20350.605,20352.19
"It might even allow me to, let's say, if there's a break point where I could of the APFR back on the c to cart as soon as Luke is clear, part of him leading.",20353.29004,20369.33997
"I'll give him one of the bags, but, yeah, I think that the rest, the bag would be a good candidate, and then allow me to inventory and stuff that one closed.",20369.33997,20376.64
Okay.,20378.995,20379.495
Look up flip seconds to close you.,20392.35004,20395.17

"And the only thing is that the, for robotics, that pitch motion, I I can see is probably we can check with Christina, but it doesn't look like it's gonna be vibrable, but maybe we could get a little bit out of it.",20751.155,20764.2
"Christina, can you can you give me a a meter and a half body in?",20764.82,20770.04

Three Quebec Quebec foxtrot three.,24059.995003,24064.2
So that's we're gonna have to reclock that APFR.,24064.74,24067.479996
Correct.,24072.815,24073.315
We'd you want me to put this back in the airlock?,24106.905,24108.905
"That would be preferred, I think.",24108.905,24110.445
We're happy with your preference.,24111.865,24113.325005

Alright.,24140.34999,24140.75
Thanks for double checking.,24140.75,24142.05

"Well, you're gonna need to read to it somewhere wherever you want to either there or on the WIF extender your call.",24273.51498,24278.655
Yeah.,24280.05,24280.21
I know.,24280.21,24280.53

"The medium ORU bag is backlit airlock, and, thermal covers closed again.",24290.02502,24296.605
Okay.,24298.265,24298.765
"Thanks, Drew.",24299.05002,24299.85

"So What I'm gonna do is, send you down to one, I think.",24321.28998,24327.065
Yep.,24328.64502,24328.885

I'm getting ready to be your key to it.,24355.31,24357.49
"So, Drew, we need to stabilize your met rates a little bit.",24378.335,24381.69498
So we'll just have you hold there for a couple minutes.,24381.69498,24384.19498

"Release your, fairly not five hundred.",24526.225,24529.125
There it goes.,24542.61,24543.43
I'm glad you're fairly not five hundred.,24545.38495,24546.90497
So you're gonna leave it in the leave in place.,24546.90497,24548.745
"Oh, that one, I'm gonna leave it in place.",24548.745,24550.685
K.,24550.90497,24551.28
I just indicate the car through you.,24551.52,24553.54004
"I mean, at this point, we can probably just go together.",24554.64,24557.2
Yeah.,24557.2,24557.44
I think so.,24557.44,24558.24005
"I think that's Don't get deferred, but, anyway, continue on.",24558.24005,24561.655
K.,24582.605,24582.925
"And the JV refi, the VIP is twelve?",24582.925,24585.505
Hey.,24586.83,24586.99005
It's gonna keep going.,24586.99005,24588.21
I'm just checking here.,24591.07,24592.11005
I don't have it written.,24592.11005,24593.25
"Oh, it's with eleven with eleven, actually.",24594.465,24597.125
It's similar.,24597.585,24598.325
I got it.,24598.865,24599.765
A clocking of ten.,24600.08,24601.38
Clocking of ten.,24604.24,24605.94
Okay.,24607.12,24607.62
"So ten on the single line, four in, on the double line.",24612.485,24617.305
"And, yeah, Drew, it's that Medox canister is not doing you any favors.",24618.91,24622.109999
So we're we're just being a bit conservative here.,24622.109999,24624.509998
"So let's let Luca finish this out, and then, and then make it decide whether you're both gonna go or just Luca goes.",24624.509998,24631.435
Okay.,24634.454998,24634.954998
Okay.,24649.855,24650.355
"I've installed the four It's a double line, and I have a two two test two in good faith test.",24650.415,24663.805
"It's good, Luca.",24672.38,24673.35999
Okay.,24675.34,24675.84
You see my wrist?,24677.17999,24678.399994
"And, Just give me give me a plan.",24710.83,24717.315
"K, Luca.",24718.415,24719.235
"You can start translating up the sea to spur, and I'm gonna give you guys the big picture here.",24719.33,24723.35
Am I away?,24733.845,24734.58499
Okay.,24740.97,24741.37
So here's the here's where we're at.,24741.37,24743.13
It's based on that Maddox canister for Drew.,24743.13,24746.425
"It's behaving now that he's not moving, but if we're afraid if we send Drew back out there, we may limit ourselves.",24747.445,24754.25
"So if you guys are good with the plan, we could have Luca go out and do one or maybe both cameras and have you just take care of the airlock there, Drew.",24754.63,24763.83499
"If you really wanna follow them out, we're okay with that, but you're gonna have to really manage the met rates.",24765.015,24769.915
"I would, I'd really like to pull them out, and I will go super super slow.",24772.91,24778.535
Okay.,24779.47499,24779.97499
Alright.,24780.11499,24780.61499
We're good with that.,24781.315,24782.435
Super slow.,24782.435,24783.33499
Alright.,24791.39,24791.87
So So we're all on the same page.,24791.87,24793.735
Luca is leading out.,24793.735,24795.115
"He's picking up the bag and heading out to CP, eight and nine.",24795.175,24799.675
"And Drew, you're following him slowly behind him.",24800.79999,24803.54
"It's fairly then, Luca.",24810.595,24811.895
Okay.,24812.435,24812.935
"And, Will, do we have any initial pulling back on EMS to be able to do anything with it yet?",24824.875,24829.935
No.,24830.795,24831.115
Nothing really happens till tomorrow at this point.,24831.115,24833.56
"We won't have any insights until, at least tomorrow, maybe longer from what I understand.",24833.56,24838.7
"But, but it still has a good heartbeat as far as we know.",24839.0,24842.68
"So, we we definitely didn't do any damage to it.",24842.68,24846.355
"K, Luca.",24885.09,24885.56998
I see you got the bag and you're heading out.,24885.56998,24887.59
So you're gonna go to the nadir light first.,24887.65,24890.06998
The zenith light is not ready.,24890.61,24892.44998
We still got another seventeen minutes on the countdown clock for the zenith light.,24892.44998,24896.845
K.,24899.78497,24900.28497
It worked.,24901.06497,24901.805
Yeah.,24906.1,24906.42
That's rejected route.,24906.42,24907.80002
Just straight along phase one.,24911.185,24913.04498
And then let me pull that up.,24913.50497,24915.205
"And, Luca, and I I'll have, a little bit.",24917.82498,24920.50998
I I'll be able to see ahead of you and tell you when you need to turn north south.,24921.94998,24925.33
Okay.,24925.62997,24926.03
Cool.,24926.03,24926.53
To do the nadir one first.,24926.965,24928.48502
So Yeah.,24928.48502,24928.885
Nadir.,24928.965,24929.20502
Fifty nine.,24929.445,24930.265
Uh-huh.,24930.405,24930.905
K.,24937.43,24937.66998
"That's helpful, Drew.",24937.66998,24938.47
If you can give him a vector.,24938.47,24939.93
"K, Luca.",24950.565,24951.285
"As you approach FHRC, you may hit the end of your tether.",24951.285,24954.30002
So just be ready.,24954.30002,24955.1
You may need to drop your green hook.,24955.1,24956.80002
Okay.,24960.22,24960.72
Don't see that.,24962.385,24963.36502
Okay.,24968.14502,24968.545
And the light is just two bays outboard from the FHRC.,24968.545,24972.01
Now five hours and twenty six minutes into the spacewalk today.,24974.07,24977.69
"All systems are showing a healthy AMS as they go through preliminary testing, crews are reporting here on the ground.",24978.07,24984.875
"Drew Morgan and Luca Parmatano are now making their way over to the intersection of the p four and p six trust to begin a get ahead task, removing lens filters that have fogged over creating a hazy vision for two high definition cameras.",24987.415,25000.29498
"We have powered off the light greater than one hour, so that's okay.",25001.235,25004.53497
"On the high definition camera, do not touch the vent ports and then, avoid inadvertent contact with the window shroud.",25004.995,25015.66
So you shouldn't have any need to really touch the camera except for the lens itself.,25015.935,25019.475
Avoid contact with any z ninety three paint or camera silver teflon.,25020.49503,25026.33
So that p the PTU would allow it to twist will not be locked.,25029.90997,25037.415
So you're gonna minimize loads when you're above that the joint where it twists.,25037.415,25041.915
And try not to put any rotations into it.,25042.65,25045.31
Avoid inadvertent contact with a high definition camera antennas.,25046.01,25050.03
"And quartz aperture, avoid imparting kick loads above the launch restraint volt.",25050.985,25057.245
"And then finally, you're gonna be working close to the radiator, so you don't wanna kick the beam of the radiator.",25058.78,25064.64
Get at the camera.,25071.44498,25072.32498
"I tried to get everything, that you said, into context.",25072.32498,25077.145
I think I think I have a good understanding.,25078.71,25081.45
Okay.,25083.99002,25084.47
Copy that.,25084.47,25085.37
"Sir, you are gonna Not a camera.",25089.005,25090.685
"It's, it's off of it.",25090.685,25092.925
So should I just drop the tag here in the middle.,25092.925,25096.28
So that's the Yeah.,25096.28,25099.16
You need to you need to drop it because you need your BRT to do the task.,25099.16,25104.13998
Okay.,25106.345,25106.745
It worked.,25106.745,25107.48502
So what you need is a a round scoop and a trash bag.,25121.895,25125.835
Okay.,25130.935,25131.41
Okay.,25132.20996,25132.69

Pulling out the scoop.,25189.115,25190.495
The rest of it.,25193.59503,25194.655
This view now from Drew Morgan's helmet camera as the international space station and the space walkers fly two hundred and seventy one statute miles above the Pacific Ocean.,25205.2799997,25214.815001
Interesting.,25260.915,25261.415
"Looks like the scoop doesn't really go On the left hand side, we filed an interference with the, attachment points.",25261.555,25275.15
I got your side address.,25276.975,25278.515
Yeah.,25280.575,25280.815
I didn't remember that either.,25280.815,25281.935
Look at that is interesting.,25281.935,25283.155

He does numbers look good enough to back in the game or is that pushing it too much?,25308.35,25314.595
"I'm checking, Drew.",25320.57,25321.71
Until you get the scoop in a a trash bag.,25327.365,25330.745
"Alright, Luca.",25334.77,25335.67
You're go to translate down to the light.,25335.73,25338.39
"First thing you're gonna do is, go ahead and install the round scoop on the micro conical.",25339.09,25346.105
"Actually, before that, I'd put your local tether down on the tether point, which is just Nator of that micro conical.",25348.64499,25355.85
"Alright, Drew.",25365.94499,25366.745
"So you're go, to gather up a scoop and a trash bag and head to the zenith light, but just be real, real slow and gentle on those met rates for us.",25366.745,25377.31001
K.,25379.85501,25380.015

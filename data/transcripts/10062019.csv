"K Center in Houston, Texas.",0.0,1.38
"On a big board there on the front and on your screen shortly, you're gonna be looking live inside the Quest airlock where a group of astronauts are getting ready to kick off the first in a series of five spacewalks over the next month.",1.68,13.665
"Spacewalktober is one flight directors has so eloquently put it, in ten space walks over the next coming months.",14.205,20.55
I'm Dan Hewitt.,20.61,21.25
I'm gonna be taking you through all of the activities today.,21.25,24.15
"We get ready to send two astronauts, Christina Cook and Andrew Morgan out the door in just about an hour or so for six and a half hour EVA extracurricular activity or spacewalk.",24.225,35.579998
"Inside the room, the team's gonna be led by Flight Direct TJ Kramer, he's down at the bottom of your screen there.",37.0,43.055
They're just doing what's called a handover.,43.055,44.835003
So the team that's been on all morning is gonna be jumping in and helping out the team coming on for the orbit two shift.,44.895,52.05
"TJ's gonna be leading the team, just above him.",52.19,54.829998
"You can see in the green shirt, Alex Canaleccos, He was the off going capcom, seated next to him, Mark Van High, and we should be seen in just a little while, Stephanie Wilson, who's gonna be serving as what's known as the ground IV that voice talking directly to the astronauts during the spacewalk today.",54.829998,70.48
"All the action, though, right now, is inside of that Quest airlock where the two astronauts, Christine Christina Cook and Drew Morgan in some of the final steps before they get ready to head out the door, Christina Cook is in the suit that's floating in the center of your screen.",71.26,87.17
She's gonna be EV one or the lead space walker for today.,87.17,90.630005
You'll be able to tell which one she is once they're out there by those red stripes around the thigh portion of the space suit.,90.665,97.085
"And then on the left, still attached to the wall is Drew Morgan.",97.305,100.41
"Both of these crew members already have one spacewalk on their resume, Christina doing her first one back on March twenty ninth, where she and recently returned astronaut Nick Hague swapped out a pair of batteries, for an earlier version of what we're gonna see today.",100.41,116.975
"And then Drew Morgan getting his first one also with Nick Hague, but later on in the summer on August twenty first.",117.420006,123.200005
So this will be the second space walk for both of these crew members And what they're gonna be doing today is a little bit different from the battery space walks we've seen in the past.,123.740005,132.065
"If you've been following all along over the last few years, We've been gradually swapping out older nickel hydrogen batteries.",132.205,138.9
"These are great big, four hundred pound batteries on the outside of the International Space Station.",138.9,143.56
That are used to provide power to systems while the stations in darkness.,143.695,147.955
"We obviously have those great big solar arrays that are generating all of the electricity on board the station, and that electricity gets either directly routed to systems or stored in batteries for when there is no sunlight and you don't have anything direct to draw on.",148.015,162.145
These nickel hydrogen batteries are being replaced with newer lithium ion batteries have a much higher capacity.,162.545,168.485
"And in fact, one lithium ion battery is going to take spot of every two nickel hydrogen batteries.",168.945,174.64
They were recently delivered.,174.94,176.48001
"The latest set of six was delivered on the Japanese each TV eight vehicle, just a little while ago.",176.78,183.875
"And then it they get brought up on something called an exposed pallet, which we'll see connected to the robotic arm a little bit later.",184.175,190.675
And the astronauts are kicking off a series of replacing these batteries by removing those old nickel hydrogen ones and popping the new lithium ion ones in.,190.69,199.75
"Right now in our procedures, they're doing what's known as SAFER donning.",200.24501,203.925
So you can see at the bottom of the backpack that Christine is wearing is a SAFER unit that stands for the simplified aid for EVA Rescue.,203.925,211.73999
"It's actually a mini jet pack that if the crew members were to become untethered from station for any reason, they could use it to fly back and get to station.",212.12,220.775
So they're doing Christina's suit right now.,220.83499,222.83499
"Drew Morgan's suit will be next, and then pretty soon they'll be moving into what's known as the crew lock portion of the airlock that's straight away from Christina's head.",222.83499,230.88
"That's where they'll go in, and they'll actually shut the door, and then they'll be able to depressurize the airlock or take all of that air out of there and then open up the hatch and begin the spacewalk.",230.94,241.50499
Spacewalks officially begin on the US side when they switch their suits over to battery power.,242.20499,248.08
You'll see each of them has what's known as an umbilical.,248.14,250.88
It's a white hose that's connected to their suits.,250.94,253.535
That's providing electricity and the breathing gases and everything from station systems.,253.535,257.795
"Once they unhook those and switch over to battery power, the spacewalk will officially begin.",258.095,262.515
Today's spacewalk is expected to last about six and a half hours.,263.83,267.93
"Their primary task today will be to remove one of the old batteries and store it on that exposed pallet, take one of the new batteries off of that Bose palette and put it in the slot where they remove the old battery from, remove a second old battery, bring it over, and then swap it out with something called an adapter plate.",268.15,288.315
Here is kind of their task list for the day.,288.635,290.795
"So they're gonna egress or leave the airlock first, and then work site preparation will be them moving all the way out They're gonna be working on an area called the p six truss.",290.795,300.78998
It's the port sides of the left side of the station and six all the way out on the end.,300.78998,305.93
And the they're gonna be at something called the IEA.,306.48502,310.505
It's an integrated equipment assembly.,310.64502,312.665
That's where all these batteries are stored.,312.725,314.905
"And these provide, power to one of the power channels onboard the station, specifically the two b.",315.28998,322.03
And this is kind of a a breakdown of what we're gonna be seeing today.,322.445,325.825
You can see that exposed pallet in the center of the screen attached to the SSMS.,326.045,330.625
That's space station robotic manipulator system.,330.925,333.28
"That's the big robotic arm, and that's gonna have all of those batteries held for them.",333.28,337.52
"Again, they're gonna be moving all the way out.",337.52,339.76
"The reason that these space wire are gonna be different is the robotic arm in the past has done a lot of the heavy lifting actually swapping out the batteries, but they're now on an area of the station so far out, the robotic arm can't actually reach.",339.76,352.87
So the astronauts are gonna be doing it all by hand.,352.87,355.77
It'll take a little bit longer.,356.06497,357.34497
"That's why in the past, these battery swaps have only taken about two space walks, mostly for the crew members to go out and do a lot of electrical connections while the battery and the Dexter attachment and a lot of the work to actually swap out the batteries.",357.34497,370.5
"This time, though, it's gonna take five to do the same amount of work.",370.615,373.91498
"So, again, it's a bit of a shell game.",374.455,376.055
They're gonna be removing batteries.,376.055,377.91498
You'll see batteries referred to by numbers and also battery re referred to by letters in today's action.,378.215,385.1
"The batteries with the numbers attached are the older batteries So battery one is one of those old nickel nickel hydrogen batteries that's gonna get removed and placed in an empty slot on the exposed pallet We're gonna get one of the new lithium ion batteries battery a and put it in the slot where that first, old battery was removed, and then almost simultaneously famously, they're going to pull battery number two out and move it over to that now empty spot on the exposed pallet and then get the adapter plate underneath it and install it, and the adapter plate serves two functions, first to complete the circuit between the new battery and the attached battery discharge can control unit, and it also serves as a storage point for the older nickel hydrogen battery.",386.04,431.26498
"So they can actually store it there on that without having it linked into the system, as there's only nine slots on this exposed pallet to return old batteries to burn up in the atmosphere.",431.26498,442.62003
So some will actually stay on board.,443.19498,445.85498
That's just a quick run through.,447.675,448.955
"Now you can see they're working on Drew Morgan's suit getting that safer attached Once that's done, they'll be ready to move him into the crew lock, and then we'll be one step closer to starting today's spacewalk.",448.955,459.52
"At the start of the first EVA, EV one comes out of the airlock, retrieves the bag and puts it on the BRT, my body restraint tether.",483.37,490.75
Filed by EV two.,491.04498,492.185
"EV one translates up to the truss, out to the port side, onto p one, to drop off the anchor points for the safety tethers.",492.405,504.53
EV two takes a bag and puts it on the articulating portable foot string.,505.22998,510.265
EV one continues translating for their outboard onto the crew and equipment translation aid.,511.68503,518.985
"Followed by EV two, who translates up onto the truss and continues further out onto the p six truss.",520.68,528.14
If you two will drop off the foot restraint.,532.425,534.925
"An EV one will attach a bag to a foot restraint, and continue translating upward.",536.63995,543.54
EV one will drop off a foot restraint.,549.305,552.765
Remove the bag and relocate it to the exposed pallet.,555.77,560.83
"If you two, we'll remove a bag and stow it at the integrated equipment assembly.",566.01495,570.755
"Both crew members will install what are called gap scanners, which allow them to translate on the integrated equipment assembly.",571.58997,578.33
If you too will relocate a pistol grip tool for future use.,579.595,583.055
"The crew members install what we call scoops, which are handling aids, for the batteries.",583.83496,588.31
"If you two ingresses the foot restraint, And the two crew members remove the first of the nickel hydrogen batteries, the old batteries.",589.25,598.90497
"The two crew members, shepherd the battery between the two of them, from the IEA over to the exposed pallet.",601.4399999,608.98
"EV one ingresses, the foot restraint, and the two crew members stow the old battery onto the exposed pallet.",610.715,618.494999
"EV one removes the scoops, and the station arm operator relocates the exposed pallet to position the new lithium ion battery in front of EV one.",623.66,636.1
"If you want installs the scoops, and releases the new lithium ion battery.",637.379997,643.32
"If you want hands the battery to EV two, and the two crew members shepherd the new battery out to the integrated equipment assembly.",647.105,655.525
"If he two ingresses the foot restraint, and if he one hands the new battery over.",656.25,661.39
The two crew members install the lithium ion battery onto the integrated equipment assembly.,663.504997,668.8050000000001
And remove the scoops.,672.619995,673.92
EV two relocates the foot restraint.,677.1800000000001,679.36
They prepared to remove the next old battery.,682.165,684.985
"If you two removes the battery, hands it over to EV one, and the two crew members, Shepard, The old battery back to the exposed pallet.",689.16,700.174995
"If you won ingress as the foot restraint, while leaving two hands, the old battery over, and it stowed on the body restraint tether.",701.59499,709.96
"The two crew members, release the adapter plate, then EV two stows that on the BRT.",711.14,717.665
"EV two translates out integrated equipment assembly, while EV one stows the old battery on the exposed pallet.",719.8050000000001,728.12
"EV one, joins EV two, and the two crew members install the adapter plate.",731.01501,738.79501
"EV two, attaches the cable between the adapter plate and the lithium ion battery, and that completes the circuit.",745.5400099999999,753.595
V one retrieves the bag.,755.84001,757.62001
"While EV two retrieves the pistol grip tool, and the two crew members translate back to the airlock to complete the first EVA.",761.0400099999999,773.1650099999999
EV two ingresses first followed by EV one.,774.84001,778.94
And that was a step by step rundown of what we're expecting to see today.,784.785,789.36499
"Again, that's expected to take Cook and Morgan about six and a half hours.",790.14001,793.92001
They do have some get ahead tasks on the schedule if they get everything done ahead of time.,794.06001,798.48001
"But today, mainly looking to, again, swap out, that older battery, put it on that exposed pallet swap in a new one, get the adapter plate and a second old battery off, and that will be the first of five.",798.625,814.43001
"Again, a total of five spacewalks anticipated to take place in the coming weeks.",815.265,820.245
"The first one being today will have another one in about five days on our October eleventh, another one, five days later on the sixteenth, another five days to the twenty first, and then four more days to the twenty fifth.",820.465,832.36
That's the planned timeline.,832.36,833.66
"So five space walks in one month to get all of these batteries swapped out, and the upgrades done on this power channel.",833.8,840.36499
"For now, though, back inside of the Quest Airlock, you can see the safer unit now attached to Morgan's suit.",841.2,846.08
"He'll be moved into the airlock momentarily, and then we'll get a little bit closer to starting this spacewalk.",846.08,851.76501
They've already been in these suits for a couple hours now.,852.145,855.125
"They initially suit up, and then do something called in suit light x or size where they actually get into the suits, and they do small movements, followed by periods of rest.",855.26501,865.5699999999999
"This is to help get all of the excess nitrogen as when they're in the suits, they're pressurized, to only about four point three psi as they're gonna be working in the vacuum of space, and you have fight against this pressure of the suit as it is at a higher pressure than their surroundings once they're out there.",865.63,882.30002
"While they're in these suits, though, they're breathing pure oxygen.",882.30002,885.12003
"So they have to since you're not getting, since you're in a lower pressure and you're not getting you're not breathing in nitrogen, the nitrogen in your blood will actually tend to form bubbles, and it can form bubbles in your veins and the soft tissue.",885.3400300000001,898.7700199999999
That's what's known as the bends.,898.7700199999999,900.79
So anybody familiar with scuba diving knows that's what would happen.,900.905,904.4449999999999
"If you go from, a higher pressure deep down in water up to a a lower pressure as you reach the surface.",904.585,911.69
"So to prevent that, they do this in suit light exercise as they're breathing pure oxygen inside of that suit that gets all the excess nitrogen out before they make their way out the door, and they avoid that nasty little occurrence.",911.69,924.0350000000001
"Pretty soon though they'll move into the crew lock, and then the crew will be able to actually depressurize, that area.",925.66998,932.2299800000001
"So the hatchway between the crew and the equipment lock will close right where Luca Parmatano's floating right now, and they'll bring it down to about two psi using pumps inside of the Quest airlock.",932.2299800000001,943.3050000000001
"After that, the pumps no longer have quite enough efficiency to continue drying out air that gets stored in tanks and the rest of the here, and there will just be vented overboard, then they'll get the go to open up the hatch.",943.76,955.7649799999999
"And then once they switch their suits over to battery power, our spacewalk will officially begin.",955.82498,961.38
This is the two hundred and nineteenth spacewalk in support of station assembly and maintenance.,965.91998,972.52502
"And again, this is gonna be the the second for both of our astronauts today.",972.52502,976.4650300000001
"Christina Cook, who's gonna be EV one and wearing the suit with the red stripes again around that thigh area.",976.52502,982.2
That's how you'll be able to differentiate her and Drew Morgan once they're out the door.,982.2,987.0
So already a little over six hours for both of these crew members.,987.0,991.315
"This one today plan to last about six and a half, but we'll see just depending on how quickly they get through every and whether or not we're able to tack on some get ahead tasks at the end of the day, potentially swapping out a few more batteries.",991.315,1003.87
The space walk was anticipated to begin at about six fifty AM central time.,1006.025,1011.565
"But the crew moving pretty efficiently through their timeline so far, we'll see what the official start is today.",1011.96,1018.06
"Inside the airlock, you can see Jessica Mir, they're close to our screen.",1018.9649999999999,1023.36502
"She's been assisting with all of the suit up operations this morning, along with Lukea Parmatano, Once the actual action begins, Chris, Jessica will be the robotic arm operator.",1023.36502,1034.5500200000001
"There will be a small amount of robotic arm motion after they do that first battery swap, just move things a little bit closer.",1034.5500200000001,1040.7949800000001
"But most of the crew members will be working from foot that they're gonna be to towing out there with them, along with all of the rest of the equipment today.",1041.25497,1051.1100000000001
And if you are following along and you have question during today's spacewalk.,1076.155,1080.1
You can always head over to Twitter.,1080.24,1081.84
"Use that hashtag ask NASA, and we'll try to get through a couple of questions throughout our day.",1081.84,1086.97998
"The action's gonna be pretty nonstop once they get out the door, but we will try to squeeze in a few, when we get some chances during today's spacewalk.",1088.385,1096.565
"So again, head over Twitter, use that hashtag asked NASA, and we'll try to get to your question today on the broadcast.",1096.625,1102.87
"Now though you can see both crew members now in that crew lock section, pretty soon.",1103.72998,1108.10498
We'll be getting ready to see the hatch get closed.,1108.10498,1111.005
"And once that's closed, they'll start what's known as the depress, the depressurization actually drawing all of the air out of that crew lock section, bringing it down to vacuum that were very close to vacuum before they open up the hatch, and the spacewalk will begin.",1111.305,1126.255
"As you saw in that animation, which was narrated by Keith Johnson, he's the lead EVA officer here in the room today.",1127.03503,1134.72
"He's coordinating all the teams in his backrooms, looking at the suits and all of the different procedures for the crew members.",1134.72,1140.89996
"They've practiced these space walks numerous times along with crew members in the neutral buoyancy laboratory, making sure they have everything extremely choreographed out down to the handrails that they're gonna be suggesting for these crew members to use and also store things on as they're making their way out to the worksite.",1141.12,1159.9099999999999
"It'll take a little while for them to actually make their way out there because again, we're going all the way to the very end of station, something called the p six truss segment.",1160.2849999999999,1168.9450000000002
"P six, on the port sides on the left side of station.",1169.44,1173.06
They're gonna be making their way out there.,1173.6,1175.44
"It'll take per the timeline, about two hours almost before we're finished with the actual post depress, so right after they're done depressurizing the airlock doing the egress so that initial exit from the airlock and staging of a few of their bags and then actually making their way all the way out there.",1175.44,1195.7150000000001
"So we'll continue to follow along everything moving smoothly, both",1195.7150000000001,1200.0
"Crew member suited up, the safers donned in the crew lock.",1200.24,1203.6999998
"Next up, we'll be waiting to see that hatch get closed.",1204.08,1207.22
And this is Mission Control Houston.,1310.335,1312.255
If you're just tuning in welcome to the first of five space walk scheduled so far for October as we go through to upgrade some batteries outside of the International Space Station.,1312.255,1323.14
"Our two space walkers, Andrew Morgan and Christina Cook already suited up and inside the crew lock section of the Quest airlock Pretty soon we'll be seeing the hatch close between the two sections of the Quest airlock, Luca parmitano.",1323.44501,1339.17001
You can see just doing some last minute set up items getting some of their equipment bags in a good place for them to access before they get ready to close the hatch.,1339.3899999999999,1347.9850000000001
"If you get depressurizing the airlock, and that'll get them closer to actually opening up the hatch, switching their suits over to battery power and officially beginning today's spacewalk.",1347.9850000000001,1357.69
"Again, it's expected to last about six and a half hours today.",1358.395,1362.095
"The primary task today is going to be removing two old batteries from one section of that integrated equipment assembly, where there are currently six batteries.",1362.475,1373.52
"As you can see, we got the crew members in there.",1380.795,1382.715
"We have just verified their Heathers, and all equipment in the airlock.",1382.715,1387.79
Sounds good.,1390.8899999999999,1391.79
Complete it through step fifty nine.,1394.305,1395.825
So we're ready to pick up in step sixty.,1395.825,1397.7649999999999
One dot two two five Copy.,1397.825,1403.93999
Thanks.,1403.93999,1404.43999
Luca removed the water switch cards on the DCM.,1411.145,1413.645
And that's NASA astronaut desk Camir on the left side of your screen.,1429.8,1433.32
"Her and Italian astronaut, Luca Parmitano have been assessing in all the suit up activities today.",1433.32,1439.1
"As you heard, they're in step number sixty of, what's known as their, EVA, so extracurricular activity into light exercise pre breathe on their timeline.",1465.325,1479.435
That includes all the pre breathe activities that the crew did earlier to help purge that excess nitrogen from their blood.,1479.435,1485.375
As they're working in the lower pressure pure oxygen environment of their spacesuits have now moved their way over to the crew lock.,1485.53998,1493.63998
There's about seventy five steps in this procedure.,1493.825,1496.48502
"And then once they complete all of these, they'll be ready to depressurize the airlock so they begin drawing all of that atmos fear out of the airlock.",1496.7050199999999,1504.99002

"And so at this point, the depressurization of the crew lock section of the Quest Airlock has begun.",2134.965,2140.425
"So, again, this now pumps drawing the atmosphere out of that section.",2144.81,2149.925
It's gonna continue doing so until they get down to five PSI inside.,2150.625,2154.94498
"So, again, you're starting from about fourteen six point o, expect an alert tone.",2154.94498,2161.75

"Once they get down to two PSI, the pumps no longer have the ability to continue drawing atmosphere out, so all the excess breathing gas, and there will get vented overboard, and then they'll actually be able to be at very close to vacuum and then they'll get ready to open up the hatch and then head outside on today's spacewalk.",2182.115,2202.305
"Again, it will officially begin when they switch their suits over to battery power.",2202.365,2206.95
"But at this very moment, Christina Cook and Andrew Morgan inside the airlock, air slowly being drawn out that pressure gauge counting down.",2206.95,2217.555
We're gonna wait until they hit that five psi mark.,2217.615,2220.335
"They're gonna stop, do leak checks, resume, go down to two, turn it off, vent the excess gas overboard, open up the hatch, switch to battery power, and then kick off this six and a half hour space walk.",2220.335,2231.95
"After you get the alert tone at six point o, your next step is gonna be a five point o.",2232.255,2237.55502
You will close the different pumps on manual isolates.,2237.695,2240.5950000000003

Point zero.,2300.25,2300.99002

So the air pressure inside of the crew lock continuing to tick down starting at fourteen.,2306.545,2311.49002
We're now under ten.,2311.49002,2313.0299999999997
"Again, we're gonna go all the way down to five, and then we're gonna pause the operation.",2313.33,2317.27
And both crew members will do some quick leak checks on their suits.,2318.005,2321.705
"And then once they get good re good readings from that, it'll be time to resume.",2322.805,2326.9049999999997
They'll continue drawing atmosphere out of this section of the Quest airlock.,2327.41003,2331.27
"They'll get down to two, close the pumps off, and then be ready to vent the access error overboard.",2332.13,2338.335
Then the hatch will get opened.,2339.835,2341.53503
"Both crew members will switch their suits over to battery, and the clock will start counting.",2341.59503,2345.61505

They started out at about fourteen point seven going down to five PSI.,2437.94,2442.12
They're gonna pause and do some leak checks on their suits.,2442.635,2445.454998
We are getting closer to the official start of today's space while again plan to last about six and a half hours.,2449.114998,2455.11
"That's gonna see Christina Cook, our lead space walker, EV one, for today.",2455.489998,2459.59
"And Drew Morgan, EV two head out to the very far end of the station on something called the p six truss.",2459.835003,2466.635
"It's on the left side, the port side.",2466.635,2468.575
"To replace, several batteries today.",2468.86,2471.74
"They're gonna be swapping out two older batteries, swapping in a new one and an adapter plate in the first of five planned spacewalks to swap out twelve older nickel hydrogen batteries with six new lithium ion batteries delivered on the Japanese HTV eight.",2471.74,2486.91
"This is the third such swap we've done over the last few years, three of four.",2487.05,2491.87
"And this one, a little bit different ones that we've seen in the past, which a lot of, the actual battery swapping was done using robotics controlled by the ground here in Mission Control, Houston.",2492.33,2505.18
"But, with this case, since they're so far out on the trust, that backbone structure of the international space station, the robotic arm can actually reach all the way out there, so the crew member's gonna be doing it by hand.",2505.88,2517.135
"These aren't small batteries, they have the same dimensions.",2517.995,2521.990005
"They're each about forty inches long, thirty seven inches wide, nineteen inches high.",2522.05,2527.83
"The older nickel hydrogen batteries weighing in at three hundred and sixty four pounds, the newer lithium ion batteries are much denser, they weigh about four hundred and twenty eight pounds, and each new lithium ion battery replacing two old nickel hydrogen batteries.",2529.245,2545.0
They're gonna be moving these around by hand.,2546.615,2549.255
Something you're able to do since they are operating in a microgravity environment.,2549.255,2553.515
"But these things do still have a large amount of mass, so they'll have to be very careful as they're moving them out of their, different attachment points, and then maneuvering between the two of them at a time as we saw an in animation a little bit earlier something that the flight control team's referring to is inchworming, moving very carefully along, and then using a lot of voice protocols to indicate when they have a good grip on the battery as these large batteries will actually obscure their view of each other as they're moving them along.",2553.84001,2583.905
"But right now, the pressure continuing to decrease inside the crew lock number, just waiting until they get to five PSI, and then we're gonna hold.",2587.58,2595.63501
"They'll do leak checks, and then the depress will resume.",2595.63501,2598.77501
Point zero.,2619.73,2620.47
Copy.,2621.41,2621.89
And I got my alert tone as expected.,2621.89,2623.75
I do as well.,2623.89,2624.87
"And a reminder for Drew at five, we're gonna close the manual as well.",2662.9049999999997,2667.75998
That's five point five.,2679.415,2680.95502
Point zero First won't manage without closed.,2729.935,2737.45
Okay.,2739.32498,2739.725
"Mario as well, I'm going close.",2739.725,2741.505
"On your DCM, switch display status until leak check, question mark is played, and then, yes, for two seconds, and follow the state instructions.",2743.805,2754.06998
You do wanna work.,2754.765,2755.9049999999997
Check.,2760.605,2760.92502
Wait for easy one.,2760.92502,2762.15
Wait for give me two.,2772.445,2773.98502
"And so at this moment, we are at five PSI inside of the crew lock section of Quest.",2778.37003,2784.4700000000003
They are pausing the depress and doing leak checks on their suits now.,2785.49002,2789.575
So Cook and Morgan will do this.,2791.635,2793.315
"Usually, just takes a couple of seconds.",2793.315,2796.13
"And then once they're done with the leak checks, they'll be ready to resume.",2796.13,2799.51
"If you want, we can complete calling instructions.",2820.5299999999997,2824.925
This led my direct mail to EBA.,2825.065,2827.005
Do you want me to check think.,2830.9049999999997,2832.5
K.,2842.685,2843.005
D one eighty two.,2843.005,2843.725
After the leak check is complete.,2843.725,2845.26498
Check the authorized user is in EVA.,2845.32498,2847.3450000000003
What?,2848.445,2848.945
EV two network.,2854.77002,2855.67
"And just like that, two good leak checks on these suits.",2873.545,2876.605
And so we'll now be standing by.,2876.825,2879.4049999999997
EV two unit o two actuator EVA.,2881.43,2883.61
EV two.,2884.55,2885.27
You press pound to manualize the valve open.,2885.27,2887.77
Despite an alert tone.,2888.4700000000003,2890.09
Copy.,2890.31,2890.81
Press on manage your valve open.,2894.63498,2896.6549999999997
"And just like that, the depressurization of the crew lock now back in work.",2904.27,2909.115
So it's gonna continue ticking down now from five psi all the way down to two.,2909.57498,2914.235
"At that point, they're going to turn the pump off.",2914.55,2917.21
You want me to.,2918.07,2919.19
"For your situational awareness, the emergency impact is now open.",2919.19,2922.675
Points or your suit pressure gauge less than five point five.,2922.755,2925.975
Do you mind copies?,2926.995,2928.115
Copy.,2928.115,2928.615
"You need to when the crew lock is at two decimal zero PSIA, you will close the deepest pump, manual isobel, and then you will turn off the power.",2931.84,2944.135
Eighty two copies.,2945.235,2946.21497
And so it'll take another couple of minutes until we get down to two psi.,2952.01,2956.75
So these pumps work by drawing that atmosphere out of the crew lock section and storing it in tanks outside of the Quest airlock.,2957.61,2965.305
That way some of this air gets recycled and used when it's time to repress at the end of the spacewalk.,2965.92,2971.22003
"However, the pumps can't function below two psi.",2971.6000400000003,2974.79504
"So they'll actually turn them off, and then a small amount of atmosphere does get vented overboard into the vacuum of space.",2975.17505,2982.1549999999997
But the crew has plenty of breathing gases throughout the entire station stack.,2983.2799999999997,2987.8600500000002
They're able to fly additional oxygen nitrogen up to the space station in hyper pressurized tanks.,2988.56,2996.045
So,2999.585,3000.0
"Luca Parmatano, giving his Expedition sixty one crewmate Jessica a quick hand.",3000.0,3004.42
"But meanwhile, Drew Morgan and Christina Cook still inside of the crew lock section there on the other side of this hatchway.",3012.785,3020.82
"In just a couple of minutes, we'll almost be done with this depress then the crew will get ready to switch their suits over to battery power after they get the hatch open.",3021.68,3031.125
"And once they're over to battery power, the timer will officially start on today's spacewalk.",3031.585,3035.969997
"We'll see them come out of the Quest airlock, get a couple of bags situated and then begin making their way over to the worksite Again, as we saw in that animation a little bit earlier, they're gonna be grabbing bags with a number of tools, and then also their APFRs, they're articulately articulating portable foot restraints And that's what they're gonna be working on throughout most of the day's activities.",3036.91,3063.324997
They're gonna be heading out to the p six truss.,3063.945,3066.505
"It's on the port side, the left side of the station all the way at the end, where nearby the robotic arm already holding the HTV's exposed pallet with new lithium ion batteries ready to be installed.",3066.505,3079.59499
"They're gonna start off by removing an old nickel hydrogen battery from that integrated equipment assembly moving it over to the exposed pallet, grabbing one of the new batteries swapping it into that now empty slot, taking another old battery off grabbing an adapter plate that has been providing, power and heating to the lithium ion battery while it's on the exposed pallet, and then moving that over to the now empty slot where a second battery will go.",3079.59499,3107.79
"This is what the final configuration will look like you'll either have a lithium ion battery and the adapter plate by themselves, or they can use that adapter plate to store the old nickel hydrogen batteries on the space station itself.",3108.33,3121.99
They won't actually be integrated into the electronic system anymore.,3121.99,3125.29
It'll just be a storage point.,3125.495,3127.355
"Nine of these batteries are ultimately destined for that, exposed pallet and they'll be loaded back inside of an HDV vehicle, which will then reenter through the earth's atmosphere and burn up during that reentry.",3127.735,3141.43001
We know.,3142.315,3142.975
Best pump manage without closed.,3144.715,3146.415
And z first pump power two off.,3150.65001,3152.67001
Press pump power off.,3154.89001,3156.27

It is not locked when I'm at workstation.,3263.13998,3264.91998
I also have my green hook on my red reel.,3265.62,3269.8
It's not locked.,3269.93997,3271.0
And Drew.,3272.935,3273.755
That much.,3278.74,3279.47998
"The green hook is on his red reel, and it does not lock.",3280.9,3285.31998

"Oh, I'll give you the reels.",3294.7799999999997,3296.24
Are all and unlock?,3296.3,3300.31998
All four they they said the reels are unlocked.,3300.69998,3302.96
Agree.,3304.985,3305.485
"And if you want to meet you, that's a good contact from us here.",3306.745,3309.865
"Houston, Stash, do you still have a look at one Go ahead, Luca on one.",3309.865,3315.3

K.,3338.28998,3338.705
Let's take a look at that.,3338.705,3340.245
"His yellow hook is gate closed, fiber locked, black on black, and his green reel.",3346.41,3352.59
And that's a good config.,3356.48502,3357.525
We just think part of that was come that you called down.,3357.525,3359.8450000000003
"Christina was clipped, so we're all good now.",3359.8450000000003,3362.165

Thanks for checking.,3365.27,3366.25
You wanted me to.,3370.62997,3371.50998
"When the crew locks the delta period of the city is close to zero, you will expect an alert tone.",3371.50998,3378.07498
"And then when it's less than zero point five, e v one.",3378.615,3384.17
"So, Christina, you will open the store the e v hatch.",3384.17,3387.4700000000003
Copy.,3387.85,3388.35
And we are ten seconds from a twenty second handover.,3390.385,3392.805
"And so just there, Christina Cook reading off the configuration of all of their tethers, they use a number of different tethers throughout this spacewalk just to make sure that they're always, attached at some point to the International Space Station.",3400.77,3414.315
They'll have safety hook They'll have tethers for attaching to all of their various different pieces of equipment as they are microgravity things can float away.,3414.315,3421.88998
"If you're not keeping hands on there, and they only two hands.",3421.88998,3424.535
They're actually doing all of the walking for them as well.,3424.535,3427.255
So important to have all these tethers in a good configuration.,3427.255,3429.835
There's a lot to go through every single step of these spacewalks is very carefully choreographed so that they're not having to make any new decisions once they get out there.,3429.975,3439.37
"They know exactly where there's supposed to go, what they're supposed to have, and what they're supposed to be doing.",3439.37,3444.55502
And so the teams here in mission control are going to be helping them walk through that every step of the way.,3444.77502,3449.82
"Here, just another look at some of the key players in today's activities at the bottom of your screen there in the jacket is the flight director for today, TJ Kramer.",3449.82,3458.62
"He's joined by another flight director, Judd Freeling, who's going to be the lead flight director for space walks three, four, and five.",3458.62,3466.0950000000003
"And then over in the on the side in the blue jacket, you'll be hearing her voice real soon.",3466.555,3471.50998
"That's NASA astronaut, Stephanie Wilson.",3471.50998,3473.61
She's gonna be known she's gonna be what's known the ground IV.,3473.75,3477.1549999999997
She's gonna be the one talking directly to Cook and Morgan as they go throughout all of their procedures today.,3477.1549999999997,3483.41498
"And then on in the back of the room standing up there in the blue shirt, that's Keith Johnson.",3483.9,3488.06
He's the lead space walk officer for today.,3488.06,3490.87997
"He's coordinating a team of individuals in the back rooms, keeping an eye on the EMUs, the space suits that the the crew are wearing.",3491.145,3499.67
"They get, direct telemetry or data, of those suits down here in Mission Control, seeing things like power.",3499.67,3506.57
"Their medox or their ability to scrub CO two from the atmosphere inside the space suit as again, you can think of these suits as kind of mini spacecraft they have all of the same, items as a spacecraft, the ability for life support, pressure, pressure, environment, water, things like that for the crews, while they're operating in them for anywhere from six to eight hours during these space walks.",3507.105,3530.925
Everything proceeding pretty smoothly so far today.,3531.625,3534.44495
We're we were originally scheduled to start at about six fifty AM central looking like we might be able to get out the door a little bit early today.,3535.07,3544.45
"Again, we're looking for those suits to get switched over to battery.",3544.69495,3549.25494
We're back with you on space to ground one.,3549.25494,3551.435
And that'll mark the official beginning of the spacewalk.,3551.76,3554.18
Going back to Tether config.,3560.585,3562.205
"I don't think I reported that my two waist tethers, both right and left are gate closed fiberlock come back black on my left and right during December.",3562.585,3570.85

Good call.,3576.485,3577.045
Thanks.,3577.045,3577.545
"And right now, in the crew lock section of the airlock where Morgan and Cook are standing by, they've turned off the pump that really draws out the atmosphere during the depress as they hit that two psi point where the pumps can no longer function efficiently, and it's now",3582.87,3600.0
"Slowly venting gas overboard, into the vacuum of space.",3600.08,3604.96
"They'll get the airlock all the way down to a little less than half of a PSI, and then they'll get the go to actually open up the hatch exposing them to the vacuum of space and the outside of the space station.",3604.96,3617.935
"And then once they switch their batter or their suits over to batteries, this spacewalk will begin, and they'll be making their way out to the worksite.",3618.05,3625.029999
"Again, it'll be a bit of a long process to actually get all the way out there.",3626.345001,3631.705
They're going to the very far end of the space station's trust segment.,3631.705,3635.949997
"That's the large exposed backbone of the station, that they're gonna be moving along.",3635.949997,3641.25
They're going out to what's known as the p six truss segment all the way on the port or the left side of the station.,3641.485,3647.745
You're gonna be hearing a lot of acronyms throughout the day.,3648.620003,3651.420002
We'll try our best to translate as many of them for you as possible.,3651.420002,3655.36
They're gonna be working today.,3655.555,3656.675
It's something called the IEA.,3656.675,3658.295002
It's the integrated equipment assembly.,3658.515,3660.615
"And that's where all the batteries were actually stored are the older nickel hydrogen ones, the new ones, the lithium ion batteries are on an exposed pallet or an EP that's being held by the station's robotic arm as we speak, all the way in as far out there as it can reach Again, they're having to do all of these battery swaps by hand, unlike, the previous two that we've been able to complete.",3663.92,3689.36

"Again, we're waiting until they get to a little less than point five.",3701.810005,3705.350006
And then they will get the go to open up the hatch.,3705.465004,3708.525
We'll get that video communication back with the space station in just a couple of moments.,3712.4,3718.18
"It is common to have some short signal loss either when you're handing over between the satellites that we're communicating with the station to, or sometimes the antennas on the station itself can get blocked by things like the solar arrays depending on where the satellite is that they're pointing to.",3720.165,3735.84
"Fortunately, with the spacewalk, we're gonna have almost constant communication throughout the day.",3736.375,3741.655

"Christina Cook helmet cam number eleven today, and Drew Morgan helmet cam number eighteen.",7109.4,7115.42
"So right now, they are out at the worksite.",7119.355,7121.535
"That's getting a great look at one of these new lithium ion batteries On the exposed palette right now, there are six new batteries, and there are three empty spaces.",7121.595,7131.0599999999995
They're at the far end.,7131.36,7132.66
"You can kind of see them at the end of this pallet, there's three empty spaces, x, y, and z.",7133.2,7139.65497
They're gonna be removing battery number one that's of the older batteries from where it's currently installed on the station and installing it in slot letter x on the exposed pallet That'll be the first major task of these battery swap outs.,7139.875,7156.8150000000005
"So they're just going through the final stages of getting to work site prepared, and it'll be time to start popping out those batteries.",7156.8150000000005,7165.3099999999995
"Before we get the Spanish down, I know that, this bag is gonna stay put, so we'll want it.",7165.52997,7175.005
"My people, but I think we can do.",7175.545,7179.26
I can work with that at cleanup.,7179.5,7181.2
"Drew, if you're happy, we're happy.",7185.455,7187.155
"Then you can work to deploy the, outboard, a gaps spanner chain.",7189.695,7193.55505

"Christina Cooks were, recovered that PGT, the pistol tool from one of the bags.",7226.794998,7232.239998
"Now she's going to make her way over to the IEA, the integrated equipment assembly, where Drew Morgan started work on installing gap spanners.",7232.239998,7241.605
These are translation aids.,7242.305,7243.905
So just items that they're installing between the handrails that allows them to get around the worksite a little bit easier.,7243.905,7250.405
They're also going to be installing what's known as scoops on these batteries.,7250.9,7254.84
"They're small metallic, pieces that get attached to different points on batteries or any other, orbital replacement unit that they're working on during a space walk that just gives them a good handhold as they are gonna be removing these batteries one by one, and then through a process that our space walk officer has described as inchworming, actually bringing them over to the pallet or from the pallet over to where they're installed.",7255.06,7282.354996

Real close.,9817.99,9818.56999
He's now gonna move a little bit closer.,9819.75,9821.59
They'll hand it back and this process will continue until they're over at that exposed pallet.,9821.59,9826.65
"Also known as the EP, it was delivered on HDV eight with the six new lithium ion batteries also has three empty slots.",9828.225,9838.68001
It's ultimately going to be filled up with nine of the twelve nickel hydrogen batteries that are going to be removed over the next five spacewalks.,9838.90001,9846.915
"Again, these batteries, the large external ones that are charged by the solar arrays generating electricity for the station systems these batteries use to provide power to systems when they're in an orbital nighttime, like, right now, as they are generating new electricity with the solar arrays Alright.",9850.79001,9870.31
I'm gonna reach out for it.,9870.31,9871.75
You're ready to push it?,9871.75,9873.13

Okay.,9919.03,9919.53
And what's the battery?,9932.335,9933.375
Of the battery?,9933.375,9934.195
Let's see.,9935.33,9935.81
"The APFR is, like, Hi.",9935.81,9958.69
Let me see where you are Alright.,9958.69,9961.225
"I'm gonna do this camera, and then I think that may be our last one.",9961.225,9965.945
"So Oh, the battery?",9965.945,9974.25
Yeah.,9974.25,9974.49

Excuse me a little closer.,10034.115,10035.575
Are you there?,10037.02,10037.84
That's a battery?,10039.9,10040.7
That's a battery.,10040.7,10041.6
I'm gonna assess ingress.,10042.3,10043.76
"Stephanie to catch back up with you, we've shepherded it to the EP APFR and take any steps prior to my ingress.",10045.05502,10053.795
"Yes, Christina, double check APFR role in yaw, fox three.",10054.97,10058.99
Okay.,10062.73502,10063.135
I've got fox three.,10063.135,10064.595
Those are good settings.,10066.89502,10068.035
The SSRMS brakes are on.,10068.095,10069.695
You have a go to ingress.,10069.695,10070.835
Crew members have now made it over to the exposed pallet.,10079.435,10082.55502
I'm gonna be concerned.,10082.55502,10083.61502
Copy.,10083.67502,10084.17502
Christina Cook's going to go ahead and get in the APFR the foot restraint that she already positioned over here in front of the pallet.,10084.715,10092.8
"And then eventually, Drew Morgan's gonna hand over the battery to her.",10093.58,10097.28
And then she's gonna work to install that into an empty slot.,10097.585,10100.725
"And you made a real quick, your right wick pattern, that that you have to the boot plate Right now, it could make a wrap around the safety tether here.",10109.3,10120.195
So k.,10120.195,10120.995
Let's check.,10120.995,10121.47504
Yeah.,10121.47504,10121.635

Okay.,10149.705,10150.205
Okay.,10150.265,10150.765
Going up on an hour and forty two minutes in,10197.74493,10200.0
Today today is space walk.,10200.0,10202.26
And so I'm orbital nighttime for the moment.,10203.04,10205.94
"Andrew, do you see my left foot?",10207.44,10209.139999
It.,10209.985,10210.304999
Okay.,10210.304999,10210.625
There we go.,10210.625,10211.445
"It's, so I see the your safety tethers coming underneath the boot plate.",10212.065,10217.025
So it is gonna create a little bit engineer.,10217.025,10219.18
Okay.,10219.24,10219.64
That's or maybe down here.,10219.64,10221.42
Is it on the front or the back?,10221.56,10223.32
It's going around the front Okay.,10223.32,10224.84
Coming up the right side.,10225.08,10226.46
I see that?,10226.625,10227.445
That's good now.,10237.05,10238.589996
"Right now, Christina, Cook, still working to get into that foot strength.",10250.155,10253.78
"After what she'll be in a position to then install this recently removed nickel hydrogen battery, one of the empty slots on the exposed pallet.",10254.879997,10264.534996
"Again, a total of nine of these nickel hydrogen batteries will ultimately be installed on this pallet.",10265.555,10271.255
Name that looks good.,10271.42,10272.64
Taking place of the new upgraded lithium ion batteries that were delivered.,10272.939995,10278.32
"Eventually, this exposed pallet will go in an HTV to be disposed of as HTV does burn up through the your as it reenters through the earth's atmosphere.",10278.805,10288.185
"But for now, the battery in the hands of Drew Morgan, while Christina Cook works to get into this foot restraint, he'll eventually hand it off.",10289.630005,10296.61
"And she will break out that pistol grip tool, that drill that they used to release this battery, from its spot on that integrated equipment assembly.",10297.285,10306.345
Then install it into the empty slot.,10306.96001,10309.78001
The crew's still running pretty far ahead of their timeline.,10311.36,10315.060005
"But at the on the boot plate, to loop just in front.",10326.8,10330.34
Okay.,10330.64,10331.14

That's the I'm touching right now.,10444.38,10447.52
One hour forty six minutes into today's spacewalk.,10454.265,10457.245
"Again, targeted to the last about and a half hours.",10457.305,10460.58002
The crew is still on their first major task of the day.,10461.28,10464.16
The right foot needs to come They've more inboard.,10464.16,10467.14
On the pedal there.,10467.595,10468.815
They've already removed one of the nickel hydrogen batteries from its spot on the integrated equipment assembly.,10469.515,10476.175
"Get it ready to put it in slot x on the exposed pallet, where it's gonna stay and ultimately get disposed of along with eight additional nickel hydrogen batteries that will be removed over the coming weeks.",10476.47,10489.835
I would say you learn we'll bring the ingress aid a little more vertical.,10496.04,10499.56
Yeah.,10499.56,10499.88
Over with you?,10499.88,10500.7

Copy.,10544.245,10544.745
"Right now you're looking to the helmet cam of Christina Cook, she's EV one, our lead space walker for the day.",10559.465,10565.645
You're just tuning in.,10566.33,10567.28998
You can tell whose camera you're looking through by that small number in the bottom right.,10567.28998,10570.97

You have the battery.,15478.48502,15479.465
And this is Mission Control Houston.,15503.085,15504.685
"So right now, Christina Cook and Andrew Morgan making their way back to the exposed pallet with the battery in tow.",15504.685,15511.09
"While they're taking some time to translate, will take some time to answer a few more of your questions.",15511.71,15516.365
"Again, if you're following along, head over to Twitter, use that hashtag ask NASA I'll try to get through them when we have a couple of, the more downtime moments during today's action filled spacewalk.",15516.365,15527.48
"Our first one for right now comes from Neiman wants to know any plans in upgrading the cameras on the space suit helmets or better quality of the streaming, how old are the helmet cams?",15528.215,15537.515
"Well, the helmet cams themselves are pretty old, like a lot of the the hardware on these suits they've been used since, the space shuttle days.",15537.77,15546.225
"There are plans in work right now, though, to upgrade these to high definition cameras, which once we have those in place, get some pretty spec tacular views of the spacewalks.",15546.305,15555.33997
So look to that in the not too distant future.,15555.48,15558.3
Next question comes from Bert wanted to know understanding pairing the alpha magnetic spectrometer very complex job.,15559.88,15566.835
What's the reason AMS isn't replaced by a new one?,15566.97504,15569.53503
"Well, it's mostly because the alpha magnetic spectrometer Delta is an extremely complex particle physics experiment that took in excess of two billion dollars of manufacture and ultimately launch on a space shuttle mission.",15569.53503,15583.585
So it would be nigh impossible to replace.,15583.885,15587.425
We also don't currently have a cargo capability like the space shuttle had to fly very large items like that to the international space station.,15587.805,15596.55493
"So that's why, going in and repairing it,",15596.63495,15599.8549
"It was never meant to be done on that device, is really the only option.",15600.0,15605.12
Be around your rent a little bit.,15605.2,15606.7999997
"It's fine, but just keep an eye on it.",15606.7999997,15608.72
No.,15608.72,15608.96
It's Let's fix that in there.,15608.96,15611.035
Ready.,15611.035,15611.535
Crew member is still translating.,15613.035,15614.415
Our next question comes from echo.,15614.635,15616.475
Wanted to know who's Kafcom for today's spacewalk.,15616.475,15618.95
It is NASA astronaut Stephanie Wilson.,15619.17,15621.51
"You can see her there in the blue blazer just next to her is another NASA astronaut, Mark Vanda High, He's serving as the cap comm talking to the crew still inside the station, but that's Stephanie Wilson, you hear, get it walking the crew through each of their steps, throughout today's spacewalk.",15621.81,15636.68
Next question comes from Marissa.,15638.98,15640.66
Kiddos wanted to know how much the space suits weigh?,15640.66,15643.399998
"It actually varies depending on how many tools and other things like that that get attached, but they typically weigh in at between three hundred and fifty to five hundred pounds.",15643.555,15652.695
"Obviously, something you can only maneuver.",15654.059998,15656.219997
"And when you're in a microgravity environment, surface suits, like the ones warmed during the Apollo missions way you consider it boldly less.",15656.219997,15663.895
Our next question comes from Eric.,15672.259995,15673.86
Wanted to know what tools they're gonna be using for today's spacewalk We've seen several of them.,15673.86,15679.225
The main one that they're using is that pistol grip tool.,15679.225,15681.785
"It's kind of the space drill that they use to drive the bolts that hold these batteries in place either on that exposed pallet or, when they're connected into the station's power system.",15681.785,15691.200005
"One of the other main tools that they're using is called the Scoop they have a number of those, and those just get attached to batteries.",15691.58,15697.485
So they have something to grab on to while they're moving them.,15697.485,15700.625
"So, like, I didn't buy us a whole lot with that.",15705.74,15708.799995
Okay.,15712.235,15712.635
I have the battery.,15712.635,15713.595
K.,15713.595,15714.095
I need to get a hand on this camera here.,15714.795,15717.055
Okay.,15717.275,15717.595
I see.,15717.595,15718.19
And then our next question was wondering what are the small white dots on cameras inside of the International Space Station.,15724.11,15731.38501
That's a good eye since it's actually radiation damage to the camera sensor.,15731.38501,15736.365
As cameras spend time on board the international space station like everything else.,15736.58,15741.22
"They're exposed to a higher radiation environment, and it will actually cause the image sensor in cameras to degrade over time.",15741.22,15748.52501
"So at first, you're just seeing a few dead pixels, like you probably noticed, and it can actually get a lot worse to the point where the cameras are pretty unusable just from all of the damage that gets done.",15748.82501,15760.48
"So it does take several years typically for that to happen, but we do have to replace the cameras every once in a while.",15760.78,15768.205
And then one more from right now this one came from Ricardo.,15771.23,15773.79001
He wanted to know what if their noses itch?,15773.79001,15776.61
Pretty serious question.,15776.83,15778.05
It is it is something you have to think about.,15778.94499,15780.94499
"They actually have a device inside the helmets, to scratch their noses with, because as you're when you're inside of the EMU, you can't reach inside of your helmet at all.",15780.94499,15790.52
"So they did think about that, and they do have a small device inside of the helmet itself that they can scratch their face if necessary.",15790.52,15797.34
Yeah.,15798.755,15798.99501
I have the battery.,15798.99501,15799.955
You have the battery.,15799.955,15800.935
It could be in the hand off of this one.,15816.485,15818.505
Alright.,15832.365,15832.765
For better.,15832.765,15833.565
Yes.,15833.565,15833.965
For better.,15833.965,15834.545
Drew Morgan and Christina Cook continuing to make their way with this battery.,15846.29,15850.015
"Stephanie, are we with you?",15850.795,15853.675
We have made it to the APFR.,15853.675,15855.135
Yes.,15858.59,15858.99
Nice work.,15858.99,15859.62997
"Nice, shepherding.",15859.62997,15860.61
And you can verify the role and yaw of the APFR.,15862.59,15865.40997
"Likely it's Gulf three as it was before, and they were happy with that if you are.",15866.145,15870.005
Hi.,15872.785,15873.08
Okay.,15873.31998,15873.63998
That's affirmative.,15873.63998,15874.37997
"It is soft three, and I can confirm that.",15874.52,15877.96
"If you're a go, I will be in my Yes.",15877.96,15882.225
The brakes are on.,15882.545,15883.505
"You are go to ingress, and I have one caution, for a braking torque on the adapter plate at the EP.",15883.505,15891.25
When braking torque apply less than fifty five pounds force.,15891.41,15895.43
Copy.,15895.49,15895.99
"And, Drew, you're good with me to ingress this time?",15901.085,15903.485
I'm good.,15903.485,15904.125
Yep.,15904.125,15904.625
We're in a good hand up spot.,15905.325,15906.945
Yes.,15908.18002,15908.68002
"And now that the crew members are back at that, exposed pallet, they're gonna be reinstalling.",15949.35,15956.22498
"Well, they're gonna be installing, this battery into an empty slot first, they have to remove the adapter plate from slot letter a.",15956.925,15964.96
Now adapter plates eventually are gonna get carried back over and installed in slot two where the battery that Drew Morgan's holding on to right now just came from.,15965.58,15975.505
"So right now, Christina Cook working to get into that foot restraint she's gonna break out that pistol grip tool again and remove the adapter plate on the right pedal.",15976.045,15985.11
Copy.,15985.49,15985.89
Yep.,15985.89,15986.37
"There you know, you're clear of this and she'll eventually transfer that over to Drew Morgan who's gonna spell it.",15986.37,15996.13498
And then after the adapter plate is off battery two will be going into its spot.,16003.61,16009.205
It looks like the right outside of your foot is a little bit high.,16010.945,16013.825
So if come more vertical toward me.,16013.825,16016.27
It'll flatten it out.,16016.27,16017.49
It looks good.,16019.87,16020.59
It looks like you're in contact.,16020.59,16022.05
Looks like that is a little more rotation in your there.,16022.725,16028.505
And the right outside of your foot's just a little high.,16031.34,16034.0
And you could see the adapter plate.,16044.7,16046.22
It's a large black object right in the field of view from Christina Cook's helmet cam right here.,16046.22,16051.68
"Again, it was used to provide keep a live heat for these lithium ion batteries while they were still installed on the exposed pallet.",16053.82498,16060.72498
They eventually get carried over and installed in place and are connected to the newly installed lithium ion battery to complete the circuit between the two.,16062.53,16070.94998
"Linking them up with that battery discharge control unit, one of which typically connects to two nickel hydrogen batteries only one lithium ion battery in their places now.",16071.41498,16082.27002
It also has the potential to serve as a permanent stowage option for a couple of these nickel hydrogen batteries as they can only bring nine of them back through the earth's atmosphere to burn up And we are replacing twelve of them during this series of spacewalks.,16083.93002,16099.62
I'll put a little bit too deep.,16099.62,16101.96
"You're in contact with the plate or fell over the plate, but I just think it's, deep in the to loop.",16102.795,16109.055
Okay.,16110.635,16111.135
Okay.,16130.77,16131.09
We're backing it out a little bit.,16131.09,16132.45
And then Alright.,16132.45,16133.83
Yep.,16133.89,16134.39
Graman.,16134.695,16135.195
Yep.,16135.255,16135.495
I think you are.,16135.495,16136.555
K.,16136.855,16137.015
And my ingress aid is stowed.,16137.015,16138.795
At?,16139.255,16139.755
"And I Stephanie, I am ingress.",16140.77496,16143.195
ATSR.,16144.14,16144.64
"My ingress aid is stow towards me, and I'm ready for a step.",16144.86005,16149.28
Copy.,16150.78,16151.18
Are your tethers clear?,16151.18,16152.305
And it's clear.,16156.305,16157.125
"And, is it the battery is low by the trigger?",16158.305,16161.045
Copy.,16161.425,16161.925
A good time to perform a ret swap.,16162.31,16164.49
Christina attach your BRT ret to the battery tether point.,16166.79,16170.01
Copy.,16173.48505,16173.98505
We are too ripped to battery to the point in work.,16174.04504,16176.54504
"Alright, Drew.",16198.645,16199.205
So this hand,16199.205,16200.0
"Off, because of the long distance to the battery tether point as it goes to the fuse.",16200.0,16205.2999997
"I'm wondering if we may have to view the bubble where And, excuse me, I got to the battery tether point and send send it back to you.",16205.68,16213.434999
That's fine.,16213.434999,16214.094999
K.,16214.3949995,16214.8949995
Bye.,16215.035,16215.535
I have the scoop.,16218.12,16219.08
Hey.,16219.08,16219.32
You have the scoop.,16219.32,16220.28
And you have the battery.,16220.28,16221.32
I think I'm going to review.,16221.32,16222.52
I can see the leaks.,16222.52,16223.880001
Yep.,16223.880001,16224.04
What's good?,16224.04,16224.86
"Oh, and I think to pass, Alright.",16233.64,16239.08
"And Stephanie, I am ready to the router's other point.",16239.08,16243.445
Copy.,16246.784996,16247.284996
"And, the final config h one on your BRT, ten seconds to a thirty second handover.",16247.664997,16254.789997
Okay.,16255.969997,16256.37
And Copy.,16256.37,16258.845
"And, Drew, I'm good for you to remove your rest.",16258.905003,16261.645
And another one of those quick handovers.,16275.335,16277.435
"So we should be getting, that signal back with the station in just a couple of seconds in the meantime, let's do another one of your ask NASA questions.",16277.575,16286.43
"This one comes from Big Boy who said, let's say the astronauts lose his or her grab, what will happen if they drift off into space.",16286.43,16293.635
"Well, as you can see, they use a lot of tethers to make sure that they're constantly attached to the station.",16294.575005,16299.215004
"If they were to become detached, they do have the safer small jetpack to get them back to the station.",16299.215004,16304.92
So they do have backup options if that ever did happen.,16304.92,16308.78
Running back?,16312.025,16313.085
"If, we had, Jessica bring it, thirty centimeters.",16313.945,16319.244995
With your feet?,16320.56,16321.46
"You said, what do you, how would that impact your ability to get us, each fixtures?",16321.6,16326.82
I could hold the PC upside down and then what would you do?,16327.835,16330.815
How big of a hassle will that be for you?,16335.59,16338.39
I think it'll be good because it would allow you to transfer talking about two translate directly onto it.,16338.39,16343.45
"I'm just thinking about the AP play part, and that's that I just right now, I don't wanna go down your Yep.",16344.23,16350.25499
Ingress name.,16350.45499,16351.015
I agree.,16351.015,16351.67499
I think that's a good trade off.,16351.97499,16353.75499
Alright.,16353.78,16354.28
"Well, we're back.",16355.66875,16359.94626
"Airbag, I think.",16361.735,16363.095
"Stephanie, we have you back?",16363.095,16364.475
Yes.,16365.815,16366.05501
We're back with you.,16366.05501,16367.27501
K.,16369.03001,16369.53001
We were discussing options for Drew's translation onto and off of the EP.,16369.59001,16373.77
And I think we decided that we'd like to have him be able to translate directly onto it.,16373.99,16379.365
This will require GCA.,16382.065,16383.525
Copy.,16387.77,16388.27
And we're fine with that.,16388.65,16390.27
We can hand you over to Jessica for that.,16390.97,16393.23
I'm with you on one.,16396.685,16397.64499
"Christina, Drew.",16397.64499,16398.625
Yes.,16399.56499,16400.06499

She's inside the station at controls of a robotics workstation.,16418.96501,16422.66501
"She's actually maneuvering the robotic arm a little bit, doing some fine tuning touches to give better access for these space walking astronauts that robotic arm holding the entire palette.",16423.35,16434.155
Good motion.,16444.06999,16444.81
I'll be continuing.,16447.18999,16448.09
Continue.,16449.90999,16450.40999
Here comes twenty five ramping out.,16455.17499,16457.275

"Two if we can go brakes on, I'll give it a shot.",16467.41498,16469.995
"And if I could jump in, I'm actually gonna probably need about twenty centimeters body in towards me.",16470.215,16477.65002
"So if that will help you, Drew, we could put that in now.",16477.71002,16480.59003
Yeah.,16480.59003,16480.83002
Let's do that.,16480.83002,16481.79

"Where Stephanie, are we both go to go ahead and translate to the EP?",21100.21999,21104.615
"Can we leave for worksite now or any, trees that we need to do out here?",21104.674995,21109.575
"Yes, Christina.",21112.2,21113.02
"You can, start your translation to the EP.",21113.08,21116.16
We have a little more work for Drew at the IEA.,21116.16,21118.38
Okay.,21122.205,21122.605
Copy.,21122.605,21123.105
Alright.,21130.56,21130.95999
"And with that battery three now installed on to that adapter plate, reconfiguring the APFR.",21130.95999,21136.765
That's affirmative.,21138.025,21138.84499
"You'll roll it back to a foxtrot to be upright with the middle column of batteries, and then we have some scoop work.",21138.98499,21144.605
We'll operate the foxtrot.,21150.26001,21151.64
"And with the crew moving quickly through this get ahead task, they are gonna attack one more on for the day.",21155.97499,21162.17
"Christina Cook's gonna start making her way back over to that exposed pallet and start preparing one more battery, another lithium ion battery to get removed and moved into its new slot to actually start to get it integrated with the station's electric power system.",21163.13,21179.59999
One of the battery we were just working on to the PFCFH four.,21179.73999,21183.51999
K.,21190.105,21190.265
Copy.,21190.265,21190.585
H one from the battery we just placed.,21190.585,21192.685
And that's a good debt retrieval location.,21200.565,21202.585
So right now what's gonna happen is Christina Cook has made her way over to that exposed pallet.,21233.76001,21238.385
"Once she gets there, first task for her is going to relocate some scoops.",21238.385,21243.125
"Again, these scoops are those metallic objects you see at them attaching to the batteries, that gives them an actual handhold for maneuvering the battery back and forth.",21243.185,21251.67
She's gonna take the ones off of the nickel hydrogen battery that was relocated over to the exposed pallet.,21251.73,21260.495
"She's gonna take them off and attach them to the lithium ion battery in slot bravo, or b, that she's gonna be then detaching, and then moving it back to the integrated equipment assembly with Drew Morgan once he makes his way over.",21260.495,21276.92502
"Before he heads over, Drew Morgan's relocating a scoop from one of the batteries, in slot two over to another point on the IEA that integrated equipment assembly just to give him an additional handhold as they get ready to install this new lithium ion battery.",21278.185,21298.12
This battery is going to go into slot three on the IEA that integrated equipment assembly.,21298.41998,21304.335
That's where they just pulled a nickel hydrogen battery out of before attaching it to an adapter plate.,21304.555,21311.34
"So, again, the shell game continuing, you had we started off with an empty slot on the exposed pallet or three empty slots, one that was filled with a nickel hydrogen battery, and that just kind of opened up the piecemeal that we're now gonna follow to begin swapping out all of these batteries over the next couple of weeks.",21311.34,21330.76
Clocking for the PFCS h four is six o'clock.,21334.055,21337.035
Thanks on each four PSCS in lock.,21376.07,21381.53
Copy.,21383.11,21383.59
Thank you.,21383.59,21384.33
"With the completion of the APFR work and the scoop work, we show you complete at the IEA.",21386.695,21392.155
"Translate, near the EP for the battery hand off.",21392.81998,21395.87997
But this one that will not require me to be on the EP.,21403.725,21406.86502
We believe you will not have to be on the EP.,21413.07,21415.57
With Drew Morgan done relocating that scope?,21427.43997,21430.0
He's gonna translate or move over towards that exposed pallet.,21430.0,21434.25998
Where Christina Cook's already making her way to.,21434.375,21436.535
She's setting up the foot restraint to get in and begin releasing a battery.,21436.535,21440.635
"While they're in that transit work, let's try to get a couple more ask NASA questions in there.",21441.095,21445.85
"This first one comes from noni, and I've seen this a couple of times wondering if those are mirrors on their hands.",21445.85,21451.53003
"And if so, what do they use for.",21451.53003,21453.285
"They are mirrors, and they're actually used to read the different displays on the front of the suit, kind of on the chest of the the EMU, the space suit that they're wearing.",21453.585,21463.69
"It has a lot of the data readouts, things like oxygen levels, pressure.",21463.69,21468.03
It has their cooling temperature control.,21468.16998,21471.34497
"And since the suit is configured in a way where you can't bend at the neck to actually look down and see that, that use a mirror to look at it.",21471.56497,21480.03998
That's also why all of those displays are printed backwards.,21480.03998,21483.58
"So if you were to look at, just the outside of one of these suit would see all of the writing backwards because they used that mirror to actually look down and see the readouts on the front of their suits.",21483.71997,21495.545
Our next question comes from Joshua.,21497.68,21499.52
"He said, how did the EVA planners decide on five space walks for the battery replacement sequence?",21499.52,21504.9
"And if all the batteries are done in the first four, would the fifth one be canceled?",21505.375,21509.23502
"Well, they plan all of these space out walks out very meticulously, and they actually do a lot of trial runs in what we call the neutral buoyancy laboratory.",21509.695,21518.81
It's our giant underground swimming pool where we have a full mock up of the space station and they're actually able to move with astronauts through all these different procedures.,21518.95,21528.535
Worrying is around the the But that's how they come up with how long they expect these activities to take.,21529.12,21535.2
That's how we land it on five.,21535.2,21536.705
I think I just got it free.,21536.78503,21538.645
Yep.,21538.705,21539.10504
So I can just give it a a tug.,21539.10504,21541.34503
"It's, in between the BRT and mini workstation.",21541.34503,21544.565
Okay.,21544.78503,21545.185
I think if it's Just pull on it.,21545.185,21547.95996
Turn your weights toward me.,21548.01996,21549.63995
I'll give it a thumbs.,21550.66,21551.95996
"But just to finish on that last thought, if all the batteries are done in the first four, the fifth spacewalk may not happen.",21553.995,21561.035
Alright.,21561.035,21561.27496
It depends on if they have other items that are deemed a high enough priority to take part in their own space walk.,21561.27496,21568.31995
"But as we've seen, the crew members getting through all their tasks and two of the tasks that were already slotted for the second spacewalk, so it is feasible that they could complete all of this work in less than five.",21568.62,21579.80505
So our next question real quick comes from Dave.,21584.02997,21589.765
"If you wanted to know how many space walks have there been in the history of the international space station, There have been two hundred and eighteen.",21589.765,21597.055
This is the two hundred and nineteenth in those,21597.115,21600.0
Hundred and eighteen spacewalks.,21600.0,21601.3
"There's been fifty six days, twenty three hours and twenty six minutes of spacewalking time, and we'll update that number at the end of today's activity when we get the final closeout time.",21601.52,21612.875
"Right now, we're already four hours, fifty two minutes and counting, into today's spacewalk.",21612.875,21617.619999
Our next question comes from space siblings.,21628.975,21631.135
They wanted to know if we're gonna be adding any new modules the station in the near future.,21631.135,21635.69
"There's a good chance that we're gonna be looking at potentially adding commercial modules to the station, in the not too distant future.",21636.23,21644.725
"There are also two Russian modules, which are slated to launch arrive at a new laboratory facilities, again, in the not too distant future.",21645.504997,21654.030003
"So the space station hasn't increased in size very much over the the last couple of years, one of the most significant additions, probably the Bigelow expandable activity module, but there is gonna be some more work coming up in the future to add more stuff onto the station, make it even larger.",21654.030003,21671.14
"Drew, I will take any, and I'll help you are willing to offer for this bill.",21672.515,21675.635
Right?,21675.635,21676.135
I'm set.,21676.515,21677.175
"And Christina, prior to ingress, there is a scoop relocation from battery alpha to battery bravo that you could do free float.",21679.85,21688.19
Okay.,21695.185,21695.67
"So, there's, like, me to translate to the ET so I can do that and then ingress?",21695.83,21702.17
That might make more sense for me to get out there.,21705.195,21707.615
Christina.,21715.05,21715.21
Do you know the snow?,21715.21,21716.090004

Okay.,21724.945,21725.425
Copy.,21725.425,21725.925
"The case, Nana, one way or the other, I think we'll need the ingress eight out because then since we lost our TCA business, I won't be able to reach across stuff through.",21739.495,21748.23999
Yeah.,21748.23999,21748.56
"Oh, yeah.",21748.56,21749.22
That'll definitely come up.,21749.28,21750.56
I agree.,21750.56,21751.22
"Drew, Christina, for the scoop move, either way fine.",21757.75499,21761.26999
Whatever your assessment is as to who could accomplish it more easily.,21761.26999,21765.60999
Okay.,21769.10999,21769.60999
"Well, just only for work in parallel, I'm thinking maybe while I ingress.",21770.40501,21774.02501
Yep.,21774.645,21774.725
Alright.,21774.725,21775.205

Christina Cook's gonna be making her way into the foot restraint.,21877.61502,21881.01
"She'll be using that pistol grip tool again, that drill to release, battery bravo, battery b, And then they're gonna once again carry it over in tandem, passing the battery back and forth between each other as they move down the handrails, over to the integrated equipment assembly, where they're gonna install this into the now open spot, where battery three was until it was just moved by these face walkers about thirty minutes ago.",21881.15,21909.48502

Unlock the ret twenty seconds to a twenty second handover.,22508.865,22512.405
Okay.,22516.19,22516.59
That'll be in work.,22516.59,22517.65
"And another one of those quick handovers will get that video and, audio come back with the crew members momentarily.",22545.54498,22552.78
The station communicating with the ground through the teacher's tracking data and relay satellites.,22554.6,22559.275
Hello?,22560.295,22560.795
We'd allow the teams here in Mission Control Houston continuing to follow along step by step with the crew members.,22560.855,22566.39502
"We're five hours, eight minutes into today's spacewalk.",22567.29,22570.09
Alright.,22570.09,22570.33002
I'm the one you're sending me.,22570.33002,22571.87
"Christina Drew, we're back with you.",22576.035,22578.055
Remove the battery.,22579.155,22580.29498
"And, for the ending config Drew will ret to the h one scoop.",22580.755,22585.96
"He'll have h one, in his hands.",22586.34,22588.82
"Christina, you'll have h two in your hand.",22588.82,22590.755
K.,22592.515,22592.835
Copy.,22592.835,22593.335
It is removed.,22593.39502,22594.295
"And, Drew, do I have clearance to start moving it to you?",22594.755,22597.315
Search from the EP?,22597.315,22598.535
You do need to back away just a couple inches.,22599.35,22601.67
Yep.,22601.67,22602.07
"And then you'll have to fully extend that h one to me, but you're clear of everything.",22602.07,22607.77
K.,22608.07,22608.57
"If we rotate ends up a little bit, it'll bring the scoop toward your fence towards your head.",22609.095,22615.01498
Yep.,22615.01498,22615.255
Continue doing that.,22615.255,22616.29498
Con yep.,22616.29498,22616.85498
Continue.,22616.85498,22617.35498
Continue.,22617.86,22618.36
How is your reach?,22619.46,22620.59998
"I still haven't read it, so you can grab it and then read.",22626.815,22629.555
Okay.,22630.335,22630.835
Correct.,22630.895,22631.395
You bring it down?,22631.775,22632.915
Alright.,22637.04,22637.52
"Can I help, sir?",22637.52,22638.58
K.,22639.32,22639.82
Let me know when you have it.,22640.56,22641.94
It could be best if I go ahead and get the red on now while the control of it.,22642.0,22646.545
Okay.,22646.545,22647.02502
Copy.,22647.02502,22647.52502
Rest on it.,22656.58,22657.3
Right.,22657.3,22657.8
K.,22658.1,22658.41998
I have That's the battery.,22658.41998,22660.14502
Okay.,22660.14502,22660.465
Standby.,22660.465,22660.785
I'll remove my RET of the battery.,22660.785,22662.885
K.,22665.585,22665.745
My my RET is removed.,22665.745,22667.20502
Alright.,22669.0,22669.40002
"I have the battery then, and I'll bring it a little bit towards me and give you some room.",22669.40002,22673.88
Okay.,22673.88,22674.2
Copy.,22674.2,22674.7
"And, Stephanie, am I egressing at this point?",22675.565,22679.425
Yes.,22679.645,22679.965
"With that Christina egress and, work together to shepherd the battery to the IEA Fends away from structure.",22679.965,22686.5
"And with the new battery now in hand, Christina Cook gonna make her way out of that foot restraint, And then they'll begin this interim process one more time slowly transitioning down the trust segment over to where they're gonna install this new battery.",22693.155,22708.755
"Drew Morgan will move a few inches and then give, Christina a chance to catch up.",22709.375,22714.495
They'll hand the battery back and forth.,22714.495,22716.435
And you'll hear very clear callouts between them when one has the battery and one acknowledges that the other has it.,22717.5,22724.24005
"Aside from the handholds, there are they are using something called a ret, a retractable equipment tether.",22725.51495,22731.535
So they have additional touch points on the battery itself.,22731.755,22736.1
Floyd is okay.,22736.16,22737.46
"We'll have you coming back here, for cleanup.",22737.52,22740.42
Copy that.,22742.215,22743.03503
"Again, these are large batteries about the size of, half of a refrigerator.",22743.41504,22748.155
"Forty inches in length, thirty seven inches in width, nineteen, and height.",22749.14996,22753.38995
These lithium ion batteries range four hundred and twenty eight pounds.,22753.38995,22757.32996
"Something that large, probably very difficult to move down here on earth, able to do it in the microgravity environment it does still have mass though.",22758.96497,22766.7
"So once it's moving, they do need to have enough force to stop it from moving.",22766.7,22770.95996
So it'll be a very slow and deliberate process moving away from this exposed pallet over to the install point.,22771.01996,22777.935
Alright.,22783.85,22784.35
I'm set up to you.,22785.05,22786.25
See how far I can get.,22786.25,22787.55
And the scoops over your left shoulder there.,22791.225,22792.985
So Okay.,22792.985,22793.345
I'm about there.,22793.46497,22794.365
"And again, this is battery bravo, battery b that they have in tow now.",22808.345,22813.565001
This will be the second Lithium ion battery that they'll be able to get in today.,22814.265,22819.279999
This battery wasn't supposed to be out until spacewalk number two.,22820.06,22823.439999
But Cook and Morgan have moved very quickly through their primary task for the day.,22823.785,22828.685
Now on pace to complete two of the tasks that were originally scheduled EVA number two.,22829.625,22834.99
"But for right now, moving that battery, bravo over to its install point.",22839.77,22845.035
Quite away.,22845.035,22845.855
K.,22846.195,22846.695
It'd be a quarter two.,22847.035,22848.655
Order two.,22849.195,22849.835
Okay.,22849.835,22850.315
I'm gonna just reach for this next grill.,22850.315,22852.960003
There's an empty slot right now on the integrated equipment assembly from where they just removed and repositioned one of the nickel hydrogen batteries.,22858.06,22867.405
It now residing on an adapter plate that they installed earlier.,22867.405,22871.13
"Drew Christina, sunrise is in less than two minutes, and now I can say I've been a ground IV.",22886.39001,22891.93
"I copy that, Brian.",22894.355,22895.495
Great to hear your voice.,22896.915,22898.135
"Astronaut Mark Vanda Hyde stepping in for a moment as the ground IV He's been the capcom so far today talking to the crew still on or inside the International Space Station taking over for just a moment for Stephanie Wilson She's been the one walking both, cooking Morgan throughout all their procedures so far today.",22912.375,22932.565
"As of right now, we are five hours fourteen minutes into today's space bar.",22934.88,22939.54001
"As of right now, this is the last task probably for the crew today once they get this battery in, but Of course, the teams will take a look after they get it completed, see how much time they have left.",22942.71501,22954.25
And if there are any additional get aheads that they can squeeze in on this first five planned spacewalks for all these battery upgrades.,22954.25,22961.55501
"But the crew working very efficiently throughout all that have already completed the primary task for the day, installing one of the lithium ion batteries, an adapter plate, and re rearranging two of the nickel hydrogen, one two over to the exposed palette and then one onto, a adapter plate now on the IEA.",22963.135,22987.96
"And then if they get this, second lithium ion battery in place, they will have accomplished quite a bit on the day.",22988.82,22995.225
"Again, we're five hours fifteen minutes into a plan six and a half hour space walk.",22995.365,22999.52501
So we'll Listen in with the teams here in Mission Control to see what the game plan is after they get this next battery installed.,22999.52501,23006.31
Let me get from this one there.,23008.58499,23010.28499
Are you pretty?,23010.825,23011.64499
There's this.,23018.73,23019.47

I think so.,23074.32,23074.96
I think you could No.,23074.96,23077.435
What do you think?,23077.435,23078.075
"Like, on the PSCS or one of those in there, you can forget there and I can knock you in there.",23078.075,23084.23502
"Oh, okay.",23084.23502,23084.95502

And then I'll re grab it.,23126.72,23128.125
With my hand the other wire like this.,23128.205,23130.205
Does that make sense?,23130.205,23131.185

"And cleanup steps usually involve the crew members gathering up the bags that they brought out with them, with the tools.",24880.745,24886.365
"So first off, Christina Cook's gonna move over to the EP, the exposed pallet and grab an ORU bag, an orbital replacement unit bag that she brought out with her.",24886.585,24897.07
First grabbing the camera though out of this smaller crew lock bag that she had placed in there earlier during the space walk.,24897.815,24904.23502

Your green hook is retrieved.,26067.555,26068.935
Continue translating to the airlock.,26070.69998,26072.96
"Well, with the bags collected and the thing stowed correctly, the crew member is now gonna start making their way back to the airlock.",26094.63498,26101.69498
"Drew, bring in the adjustable with you.",26106.85,26109.35
So both Christina Cook and Drew Morgan gonna be making their way back now towards the Quest airlock picking up their safety tethers along the way.,26116.185,26124.07
Copy.,26127.33,26127.65
Translate to your green hook.,26127.65,26129.35
Location fifty three twelve and retrieve that.,26129.645,26132.865
"As they make their way back, let's knock out a few more ask NASA questions.",26139.44,26144.02
Our first one's gonna come from Anna in South Carolina.,26144.4,26147.6
Wonder how many sunrises and sunsets can one expect to experience during a a space walk?,26147.6,26153.625
How does that affect those space walking?,26153.765,26155.605
"Well, they've seen four sunsets and sunrises so far today.",26155.605,26159.05002
They're about to see their fifth one coming up in just a couple of minutes.,26159.05002,26162.27002
"Station moving around the earth, at about seventeen thousand five hundred miles an hour.",26162.65002,26166.965
"So they, do a full orbit every ninety minutes.",26166.965,26170.325
"So every ninety minutes, you see a sunset and a sunrise.",26170.325,26173.225
So they'll typically see about five to six depending on just quite how long the spacewalk is.,26173.49,26179.49
"If they do about six and a half hours, they should be seeing about five anything beyond that, they might see a sixth one.",26179.49,26186.405
"Our next one comes from Nicholas once in a while, there's still plans to up the minimum permanent crew size of the space station.",26187.745,26194.9
"There are, once our commercial crew vehicles start flying, for Boeing and SpaceX, they will be able to carry four at a time.",26196.56,26204.855
We're locked to six crew members as our standard permanent size right now.,26204.855,26208.81
"There are only three seats on a Soyuz, and you have to have one seat for every crew member onboard the space station.",26208.97,26215.79
For them to return home.,26216.025,26217.305
"So once we start flying commercial crew, you'll have that fourth seat available, and then you'll bump up from six to seven permanent crew members at a time onboard the space station.",26217.305,26227.28
"Our next question wants to know, has there ever been an occasion and the jetpack was used during the space walk.",26229.42,26235.185
"That one that we saw a little bit earlier, the safer device that has never been used.",26235.185,26240.165
"That's the piece that's attached to the bottom of their life support pack, the, portable life support system or the plus and that serves as kind of their, safety net if they were ever to become untethered from station.",26240.91,26254.185
"There was another device known as the manned maneuvering unit that got few uses during the shuttle program, but was retired and hasn't been used since.",26254.325,26263.22998
Our next question comes from Hugo said I've read that there's ten spacewalks happening in the next three months.,26268.17502,26273.855
Awesome.,26273.855,26274.355
I agree.,26274.575,26275.23502
What limits are there on when and how frequently space walks can be scheduled?,26275.97,26279.75
Why can't they do it every single day?,26279.81,26281.73
"Well, space walks are one of the most time intensive tasks that the crew members have onboard the space station.",26281.73,26288.73502
We're doing a record pace out of station airlocks right now And we have about five days between each one.,26288.875,26295.44
"That's five days for the crew to outfit and service the suits, and it also takes them time just to go over the procedures and do any additional training to get ready.",26295.44,26305.925
So spacewalks extremely time intensive And you really only do them when there's something you absolutely have to do outside the station that can't be done robotically.,26305.925,26315.35
"If we were trying to do a space walk every single day, you wouldn't be able to do pretty much anything else on the space station, like all of the science, working on hundreds of different research varyments during a given expedition onboard, along with all of the general maintenance and fixing anything else that might break internally on the space station.",26315.895,26335.0
"So That's why it's relatively rare to see a spacewalk, and this pace that we have coming up is pretty unprecedented.",26335.0,26343.505
Our next question comes from Akrish wants to know how the astronauts keep hydrated during the space walk.,26346.02997,26352.76996
Several hours without food.,26353.385,26354.745
I just continue to translate to the airlock.,26354.745,26356.925
That's affirmative.,26358.425,26359.405
"Well, they do stay hydrated.",26361.17,26362.61
They have a drink bag with a straw inside of their helmet that they can use to stay hydrated.,26362.61,26368.13
"They don't have any food available to them so they usually eat a big meal just prior to this Facebook, and then they'll have a dinner waiting for them once they get back inside.",26368.13,26376.995
"Next question comes from Deborah wants to know, is the movement during space walks that ever list or do Astroocustrine, Christina and Drew Morgan just make it look that easy.",26385.08496,26395.64
"Well, they certainly put on a space walking clinic today getting all their tasks",26396.18,26400.0
Done really quickly and a couple from the next spacewalk.,26400.0,26402.82
It is one of the most physically intensive activities that they'll do while they're on board.,26403.1999998,26408.0
"They can burn to two thousand calories or more, throughout the process of doing a spacewalk, you're constantly fighting against the pressure of the suit, making very difficult movements with all of your hands.",26408.0,26420.64
"You're basically working inside of a giant balloon, as you're walking.",26420.64,26425.22
"So it's definitely not effortless, but These crew members are able to train pretty extensively before they ever fly.",26425.279999,26432.565002
And then our astronauts are just exceptional people.,26432.945,26435.765

"And our final question for right now comes from Nuance, wanted to know, can the astronauts use the robotic arm or some kind of powered moving equipments to move the batteries and themselves around?",26443.685,26453.385
"Well, if you've been following along, a lot of these Facebooks or these battery replacements in the past have done been done primarily using the robotic arm, and it's a very dextrous attachment known as Dexter, the most special purpose, dextrous manipulator, However, these batteries that are getting replaced are so far out on the station the robotic arm can't actually reach which is why the astronauts are doing it by hand.",26453.83,26480.315

"Once the hatch is closed and the crew is configured, they'll be ready to start the repress.",28218.28,28222.54
So pretty much the opposite of what they did at the beginning of this spacewalk.,28222.68,28226.28
We're gonna be putting sphere back inside of that part of the Quest airlock.,28226.28,28230.484999

See this part.,29298.905,29299.805
"K, guys.",29301.225,29301.785
I'm gonna start throttling from off to norm.,29301.785,29304.525
"Very slowly, initially.",29305.065,29306.285
"Just respect you guys to give me, an indication of how you feel.",29306.425,29310.25
Me rotate this a little bit there.,29335.145,29337.005
Copy.,29338.32,29338.72003
Yeah.,29338.72003,29338.96
No worries.,29338.96,29339.7
"And during Christina, you can expect an an alert tone.",29342.24,29345.7
There it is.,29347.365,29348.26495
"Christina, Drew, when the crew lock will be at four point o, you can expect another other tone.",29356.29,29361.75
And then please allow me when the crew lock is five point o.,29362.485,29366.245
"I will watch from the inside, but I will go for whichever it comes first.",29366.245,29371.04
Alright.,29372.07996,29372.57996
We copy.,29372.63995,29373.3
"And how is the rate, guys?",29391.01,29392.55
And for me?,29393.33,29394.21
That's good rate.,29394.21,29395.27
"I'm happy to have it, a little bit faster if there is.",29400.39999998,29404.02
Got you.,29405.2799997,29405.6
I think you could speed it up a little bit.,29405.6,29407.3599997
I I agree.,29407.3599997,29408.18
Okay.,29408.875,29409.275
Call you guys.,29409.275,29410.015
Let me know of any adjustment I'm here for you.,29419.38,29422.039999
I show it's at one point five.,29422.42,29424.52
Hi.,29434.945,29435.23
Hi.,29467.415,29467.76
Alright.,29485.48,29485.98
"With the repress now in work, the official end time for today's spacewalk was one forty PM central time.",29486.2,29494.14
Two forty PM eastern time.,29494.465004,29496.305
That's giving us a total elapsed time today of seven hours and one minute.,29496.305,29501.365005
"Again, the final stopping point for today's spacewalk coming in one hour Sure.",29504.28,29509.16
"One forty PM central time, two forty PM eastern.",29509.24,29512.495
Total elapsed time is seven hours and one minute.,29512.875,29515.915
Today's space walk started at six thirty nine AM central time.,29515.915,29519.455
Seven thirty nine AM eastern.,29519.63,29522.13
"I'll be good with another rate, boss, if you wanna do.",29561.27,29563.67
Sounds good.,29563.67,29564.335
Yeah.,29564.41501,29564.57501
I'm about to get the front put up.,29564.57501,29566.195
I'll send the heat checks.,29568.655,29570.035
Yeah.,29574.90001,29575.14
We're at five point o.,29575.14,29576.74
We're at five point o.,29576.74,29577.96
Excellent.,29579.06001,29579.56001
Starting at two minutes for a stabilization.,29579.94,29582.835
Alright.,29643.79001,29644.29001
"And again, our spacewalk ended when that repress started and repress coming at one forty PM central time, two forty PM eastern, giving a total elapsed time for today's space walk of seven hours and one minute.",29644.35,29659.015
A couple of quick stat updates for you then.,29660.02002,29662.74002
"This was the second spacewalk for both, Christina and Drew.",29662.74002,29666.58002
This was the two hundred and nineteen in support of Station Assembly and maintenance of the six spacewalk conducted just this year.,29666.58002,29674.755
"Again, we'll go through a couple of these stats in just a moment.",29675.99002,29679.05002
The repressurization of the Quest airlock is already underway.,29679.51,29683.53
"And they're gonna do it pretty slowly, but they're gonna gradually be raising the pressure starting off from right around vacuum, eventually making its way all the way up to right about sea level with the rest of the station right around fourteen point seven psi.",29684.055,29698.2
"At this point, they're already right at about five and they're gonna, do a quick pause, at five.",29699.62,29708.905
"They'll wait two minutes for the pressure to stabilize, and then they'll continue on.",29709.44498,29714.09
"So, again, just running through some stats one more time for you.",29719.615,29722.095
"Two hundred and nineteen spacewalking, supportive station assembly, and maintenance.",29722.095,29726.035
And the sixth one conducted onboard space station just this year.,29726.335,29730.36
"This was the second space walk for, Christina Cook, now with the total lifetime spacewalking hours, thirteen hours forty six minutes.",29731.13998,29739.465
"Also, the second for Drew Morgan, he's now at thirteen hours, thirty three minutes.",29739.685,29744.425
"In those two hundred and nineteen space walks, with today lasting seven hours and one minute, we've now had one thousand three hundred seventy four hours and twenty seven minutes of spacewalking time onboard the International Space Station, and that translates to fifty seven days six hours in twenty seven minutes.",29744.97,29764.21
"Christina, Drew, good leak check.",29766.67,29768.59
You can switch the ground seaters to off Hey.,29768.59,29773.04498
My gloves heaters are off.,29773.04498,29774.645
Both heaters are off.,29774.645,29775.865
"Thank you, gloves, for any contamination.",29776.16498,29777.94498
No contamination.,29779.42,29780.24
No contamination.,29782.78,29783.6
On your DCM?,29785.74,29786.72
Switch the o two actuator to IV.,29787.325,29790.225
"And this time around, they do a quick leak check to make sure no air is escaping from the airlock as they introduce it in.",29805.60498,29812.585
"And Luca, Parmitano, we're just reporting a good leak check.",29812.97,29815.85
So And then IV.,29815.85,29816.91
EV two IV.,29816.97,29817.77
He will be opening the valve back up.,29817.77,29819.995
"Back towards normal when the delta p delta t is equal is approximately zero, inspect another tone.",29820.07498,29827.215
Copy that.,29827.915,29828.655
"And so Luca Parmitano opening up the valve, you could hear the air rushing back in through the, microphones of the space walkers.",29833.17,29842.495
It's now gonna continue to pressurize that airlock bringing it all the way up to right around fourteen point seven PSI.,29844.475,29851.18
"At which point, Parmitano and Jessica Mir will be able to open up the bring the crew members back inside and help them start getting their suits off.",29851.96,29860.055
They've been in these suits for well over seven hours as they suit up couple hours before to do their in suit light exercise and other checkouts.,29860.055,29868.25
"So very long day for these space walking astronauts, but just about to come to an end again are repressed.",29868.39,29874.465
"So the end of today's spacewalk did take place at one forty PM central time, two forty PM eastern, giving a total of elapsed time of seven hours and one minute to today's spacewalk.",29874.76498,29885.78998
"It was a fully successful one and more today as they were able to conduct complete all of their primary tasks and several get ahead tasks, actually getting some batteries swapped out, that weren't supposed to take place until the second spacewalk Is that amazing?",29886.88998,29903.49
All told they were able to remove three nickel hydrogen batteries.,29907.31,29912.985
Those are the older ones that were already installed that are getting replaced.,29912.985,29916.205
Two of those moved onto the external pallet where they'll eventually be disposed of on through an HDV vehicle.,29916.63995,29923.69995
"And one of the, batteries now residing on an adapter plate, two lithium ion batteries removed from that exposed pallet and in installed, over there on the p six truss, taking up slots one and three And then one corresponding adapter plate was installed for the first battery and the nickel hydrogen battery placed on top of it And that was, one of the primary tasks for the day.",29924.095,29952.57996
"They also did something called breaking torque, so just starting, the removal of two of the other batteries that are gonna get replaced on some upcoming space walks and reoriented a number of the scoops or those metallic handheld devices that they attach the batteries to give themselves a good handhold to pass back and forth.",29953.6,29972.39996
"So all of that completed successfully, seven hours, one minute, and Morgan inside the airlock, repressurizing.",29972.62,29979.095
"Soon we'll get that hatch back open, get them back inside, get the suits often we will end today's activities.",29979.71497,29986.64
One five.,30018.7,30019.44
How's the right guys?,30042.225002,30043.365
I'm good with it.,30045.105,30046.225002
Yep.,30046.225002,30046.725002
Of point one.,30051.79,30053.010002
So we're quickly approaching the desired pressure already in excess of twelve point one PSI continuing to climb.,30068.69,30075.090004
It'll get up to right around fourteen point seven.,30075.090004,30077.67
"And that by that point, the pressure will be mostly equalized between the section of the airlock where the crew and suits is residing section of the airlock we're taking a look in right now known as the equipment lock.",30078.245,30089.68
"Once we get there, Luca parmitano will be able to open up the hatch.",30090.060005,30093.485
"Again, bringing Drew Morgan and Christina Cook back inside.",30093.485,30096.465004
"And just like that, the hatch now opened up.",30193.875,30197.255
Parmitano would be able to start to work to move the crew members back inside.,30199.475,30203.65
Okay.,30204.67,30205.17
There it.,30207.23,30207.97
"Hey, guys.",30208.18999,30209.01
Welcome back.,30211.155,30212.215
Thank you.,30212.435,30212.995
It's so nice to see you guys.,30212.995,30214.615
Looks like we were gone forever.,30215.315,30216.855
Airlock on two.,30219.12001,30220.16
Are you ready for step four of one dot two four zero?,30220.16,30222.98001
What's that you saw on the list here?,30226.725,30228.165
You already reached out for.,30228.165,30229.865
"And Jessica, just to make sure we're in space?",30236.57,30238.41
Are we still hot?,30238.41,30239.29001
Yes.,30239.29001,30239.53
We're hot.,30239.53,30240.27
Yes.,30240.89,30241.21
You are both very hot.,30241.21,30242.49
"And, just gonna be clear from step four, the ground's gonna do that step, and you can you're clear to continue through that step.",30242.49,30251.56999
Affirm.,30254.59,30254.91
That's what we were hoping.,30254.91,30255.87
Thank you.,30255.87,30256.53
"Morgan the first one through, they're gonna attach him to the left side of the airlock.",30265.395,30269.335
From our vantage point.,30269.51,30270.95
"At this time, the Eagles are up by twenty one points.",30270.95,30273.11002
Score is twenty one zero.,30273.11002,30274.49002
Thank Wow.,30276.23,30277.345
And more just really fantastic news for Christina Cook right there.,30280.685,30284.625
So first up is removing the SAFER unit.,30290.65,30293.14
"That's the simplified aid for EVA rescue that's essentially the emergency jet pack that they have in case they were to get untethered, and they're gonna move to attached Morgan by his portable life support system.",30293.14,30306.26
"That's the backpack, the place.",30306.26,30307.96002
Airlock Houston on space to ground one.,30308.1,30309.865
The EV crew is no longer hotlinked.,30310.10498,30312.04498
Thanks.,30317.64,30318.14
"And then as these crew members get attached, they'll start systematically taking an unknown number of items off of the suits.",30324.76498,30331.405
"They'll usually start with that mini workstations of the large metallic devices, you can see in the front of Drew Morgan there.",30331.405,30338.36
Eventually moving to the helmets and the gloves as well.,30339.22,30341.86
They'll take a lot of photos of the gloves as they'll get reviewed by teams down here on the ground just to see if they notice any damage.,30341.86,30349.605
Or wear and tear on the gloves as they do usually take the most beating during these spacewalks.,30350.08002,30355.06003
"To the, EV crew from the airlock now?",30355.52002,30358.02002
We'll continue to hang with them until the helmets are off.,30358.135,30361.355
"For now, the Morgan now getting attached.",30361.655,30363.595
"Christina, five six Christina Cook will follow soon after.",30363.655,30367.22
And now Christina Cook making her way through the hatch back into the equipment lock.,30493.185,30497.425
"Again, they're gonna remove that safer, I a piece of hardware.",30497.425,30501.125
From the bottom of her portable life support system.,30501.74002,30504.96002
And then she'll get linked back onto the wall just like Andrew Morgan already has been.,30507.26,30511.345
"So with both astronauts back inside of the equipment lock, you can see both Luka Pormatano and Jessica are helping to get all the different pieces off the suits first, the mobile workstation with all of the excess tethers and tools from the front of the suits.",30811.525,30825.37
They'll take some of the helmet enclosures off the top with the helmet cams and the lights They'll also start getting the gloves off and the helmets.,30825.51,30833.41501
"You may see them taking a lot of very close-up pictures of the gloves that's done after every spacewalk and those images get reviewed down on the ground just to make sure that the crews haven't incurred any damage to their gloves as they are kind of the most, likely spots to have any nicks or cuts is they're doing all of the walking with their hands.",30834.27501,30854.875
And so we'll see them flip the gauntlet part up of the glove and start to work those off.,30855.26001,30860.4
And you can see them unplugging the gloves.,30921.87997,30923.96
The gloves actually have heaters in them that connect into the suit's powers.,30923.96,30928.28
You can see them disconnecting those cables.,30928.28,30930.13998
"And at this point, we are just a couple of minutes away from the gloves and the helmets coming off.",30987.65997,30991.65997
"Once we see those helmets come off, we will be wrapping up today's coverage.",30991.65997,30995.59998
"If you are just tuning in, you missed a very successful spacewalk lapsed in seven hours in one minute.",30996.10498,31002.60498
It kicked off this morning at six thirty nine AM central wrapped up at one forty PM central.,31002.82498,31008.56
"So just about thirty minutes ago, both the crew members have made their way back inside of the airlock after an extremely successful day able to, move three nickel hydrogen batteries.",31008.86,31021.58002
"These are the ones being replaced, from their spots, two of them out to an exposed pallet where they're going to be put in a future HDV cargo vehicle and disposed of, one of them's on a newly installed adapter plate.",31021.58002,31034.98502
"They were also able to install not one, but two lithium ion batteries today.",31035.285,31040.09998
And we're gonna be doing a total of six throughout all of the spacewalks in the coming weeks replacing twelve nickel hydrogen batteries with the higher power lithium ion ones.,31040.31998,31050.82498
"So a very successful day actually completing several tasks that were targeted for the second spacewalk, which is gonna be coming up in five days from now on October eleventh It looks like we've got the helmet off of Christina Cook.",31052.49,31068.435
Drew Morgan will be next up.,31070.52,31072.62
"Again, we do have five space walks currently planned in the month of October, ten space walks out of US airlocks from now until the end of November or early December, and then one additional Russian spacewalk in the mix as well.",31073.0,31086.885
This is gonna be a record pace Spacewalk staged out of airlocks onboard the International Space Station.,31087.345,31094.22
"The only time previously in history, we've had this many in this short of time was when we were flying the space shuttle, and you would have five or six, just in a, very quick two week span on the shuttle.",31094.68,31108.235
So a lot of work being done to swap out these batteries.,31109.75,31113.85
"And then later on, when Luca Parmatano and Drew Morgan, kick off, around five spacewalks to go out and repair the alpha magnetic spectrometer But today's space walk already in the books, again, lasting seven hours and one minute.",31113.99,31131.10004
"This was the second space walk For both of these crew members, Christina Cook Morgan.",31131.10004,31136.45496
Christina Cook now has thirteen hours forty six minutes of space walking time on her resume Drew Morgan thirteen hours and thirty three minutes.,31136.45496,31145.14
"And this was the two hundred and nineteenth spacewalk in support of space station assembly and operations, maintenance, and repair activities.",31145.44,31154.295
And just flashing up the stats for you one more time here.,31166.07,31169.21497
"Again, second space walk for Christina.",31169.21497,31171.95496
"Cook, Andrew Morgan.",31172.975,31174.175
You can see their totals there.,31174.175,31175.71497
Spacewalk say seven hours and one minute.,31175.97,31177.89
This was the two hundred and nineteenth in support of space station operations and repairs.,31177.89,31182.79
Giving us a grand total of thirteen hundred and seventy four hours and twenty seven minutes of space walking time that translates to fifty seven days six hours and twenty seven minutes.,31183.41504,31194.02
"So with this spacewalk in the books, we're now looking forward towards the next a couple.",31218.68,31224.255
"Again, we had five planned.",31224.715,31226.074999
The next one's gonna be coming up this Friday.,31226.074999,31228.394999
Cover time's gonna start at the same time for all these at five thirty AM central time with the space walk.,31228.394999,31233.58
Starting right around the seven AM hour central time.,31233.74,31237.04
The next spacewalk is gonna be the same crew.,31237.18,31239.5
"They're gonna swap positions, so Drew Morgan will be EV one, the lead space walker, and Christina Cook will swap into, EV two.",31239.5,31249.225
"And then next week on Wednesday, October sixteenth, we'll have Drew Morgan and then NASA astronaut, Jessica Meer heading out the door for the first time.",31249.605,31258.29
"Again, that'll be two and three.",31258.67,31260.27
"We also have four and five on the plan with Christina Cook and Jessica Meer scheduled, to head out the door on October twenty first, And then Luca Parmitano will get his first shot at one on this increment going out the door with Jess Camir on October twenty fifth.",31260.27,31276.58
So be sure to tune in for all of those spacewalks coming up throughout the month.,31277.415,31282.215004
Space Walk October as one of our flight directors.,31282.215004,31285.815
So eloquently put it.,31285.815,31287.16
But I do wanna join thank you for joining us.,31287.64001,31290.36
We started off early in the morning.,31290.36,31291.880005
"It's now mid afternoon, not a bad way to spend Sunday watching two people walk outside in the vacuum of space two hundred and sixty miles over your head, swapping out some batteries and getting all of their tasks completed successfully.",31291.880005,31303.555
So tune in later this week on Friday for space walk number two as we continue this fall of space walks on the International Space Station.,31303.94,31311.56
"For now though, we are going to go ahead and sign off.",31311.715,31314.854996
"This is Mission Control, Houston.",31314.91499,31316.854996
